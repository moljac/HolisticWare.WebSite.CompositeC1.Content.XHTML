	<h2><a id="">Audio pace generator for Conconi test</a></h2>

	<p>
		Conconi test represents simple method for measuring the approximate values of an
		individual's maximum, anaerobic and aerobic threshold rates.
	</p>
	<p>
		For those who are familiar with Conconi test it is well known that at later stages
		of the test, when the pace is pretty high, it could be quite difficult to read the
		data (remaining time until next mark).
	</p>
	<p>
		Today almost every person has small multimedia player even during traning, so we
		have implemented Conconi test as audio file in croatian and english.
	</p>
	<p>
		The test is based on the tabular data from the article by prof. Vučetić (KIF + reference)

	</a>

	<h3><a id="">Usage</a></h3>
	<p>
	There is 10 seconds preparation time for test. The user will hear three
	beeps before the test start  3 seconds before with delay of 1 second.
	The third sound is hihger pitched and longer and denotes test start.
	Rest is classical Conconi test... up to You...
