	<h2><a id="">Audio pace generator for Conconi test</a></h2>
	<p>
		Conconi test represents simple method for measuring the approximate values of an
		individual's maximum, anaerobic and aerobic threshold rates.
	</p>
	<p>
		For those who are familiar with Conconi test it is well known that at later stages
		of the test, when the pace is pretty high, it could be quite difficult to read the
		data (remaining time until next mark).
	</p>
	<p>
		Today almost every person has small multimedia player even during training, so we
		have implemented Conconi test as audio file in Croatian and English.
	</p>
	<p>
		The test is based on the tabular data from the article by prof. Vučetić 
		(KIF Zagreb + reference)

	<h3><a id="">Usage</a></h3>
	<p>
	There is 10 seconds preparation time for test. The user will hear three
	beeps before the test start  3 seconds before with delay of 1 second.
	The third sound is higher pitched and longer and denotes test start.
	Rest is classical Conconi test... up to You...
	</p>

	Conconi test (CT) is one of the tests for anaerobic threshold measurement. Some
	links about CT and details:

	This project is intended to make CT measurement easier. According to CT variation 
	described in:

	Ref.1:
	<br />
	"CONCONI TEST - a simple method for anaerobic threshold determination"
	<br />
	"CONCONIJEV TEST - Jednostavna metoda za određivanje anaerobnog praga"
	<br />
	by Jurica Šango, Vlatko Vučetić prof published in Kondicijski trening 
	(stručni časopis za teoriju i metodiku kodicijske pripreme)
	"Fitness training" (Expert magazine for theory and methodics of fitness training)

	Croatian fitness trainer association)
	</p>
	<p>
	During the test tested athlete-trainee is supposed to pass control points on 
	certain time points (pass the distance between 2 points within prescribed time
	interval). In order to do that athlete needs to memorize all time points (know
	them by heart) or read them from the table. 
	</p>	
	<p>
	The essence of the test is that pace linearly increases, so on the higher paces
	reading is almost impossible, sometimes causing test errors (athlete exits test
	or misses the control point on prescribed time point).
	</p>
	<p>
	In order to make CT easier this project offers audio pacemaker, audio file that
	can be played in mp3 player giving the pace (given time points to pass control
	points), leaving the hands free and without need for reading or external input
	(from coach). This reduces need for greater logistics making CT cheaper and 
	easier to conduct in everyday's situations.
	</p>
	<p>
	NOTE:
	<br />
	The control points in prof Vucetic's work are at every 50m, but in order not
	overload audio pace, this project has control points each 100m.
	First 10 s are preparation buffer, after 3 beeps the time measurement starts.
	</p>
	<p>
	The table with distances and times for Conconi Test and with some additional
	information and calculations for audio files can be found in accompanying 
	excel sheet.
