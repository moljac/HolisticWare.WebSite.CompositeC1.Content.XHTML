	<h2><a id="">holisticWare- Software Development</a></h2>
	<p>
	Offering years of experience in different areas on different platforms with 
	different tools, but eager to grasp newest technologies and apply them to 
	specific domain problems.
	</p>
	<p>
	Holisticware is paying attention to make software solutions affordable to small 
	business and even private users, therefore is trying to target several platforms 
	with minimal costs.
	</p>
	<p>
	Information about the experience collected in our projects can be read on our blog.
	</p>
	<h2><a id="">Architectural</a></h2>
	<p>
	Knowledge and experience ranges from desktop applications (rich/fat clients) 
	over web applications (thin client) and in last few months even mobile applications.
	</p>

	<h2><a id="">Operating Systems</a></h2>

	<p>
	Hundreds of man-months under all flavors of Windows and main Linux distros...
	</p>

	<h2><a id="">Technology platforms</a></h2>
	<p>
	5+ years of work under Microsoft .net and recently porting and developing some 
	applications under Mono. Nice example is this WebApplication written in ASP.net 2.0 
	in 2007-10 with newest bits like CSSFriendlyControlAdapters  (still in beta as written 
	on 2007-12-06), but everything runs under Linux and Mono.
	</p>
	<p>
	The real strength is in desktop programming mostly under .net, where a lot of 
	attention is paid to assure software quality through reusability and pragmatic testing 
	(unit tests etc...)
	</p>
	<p>
	6+ years experience in c/c++ programming in academic research on different Unix 
	platforms...
