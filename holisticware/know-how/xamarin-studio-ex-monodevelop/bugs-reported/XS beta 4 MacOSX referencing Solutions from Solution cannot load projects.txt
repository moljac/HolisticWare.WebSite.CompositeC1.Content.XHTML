# XS beta 4 MacOSX referencing Solutions from Solution cannot load projects #

When opening existing solution where project were added through referencing other
sln file in VS projects cannot be loaded anymore.

Error is Load Failed.
Could not find part of path ....

After Reload the error is unknown file format.

Adding projects separately one by one works.

Now side-by-side installation of MonoDevelop is affected by this too...

On windows XS loads project w/o hassle.

MacOSX installation:
* Mountain lion 
* case insensitive
