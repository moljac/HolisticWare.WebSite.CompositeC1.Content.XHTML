Tips and tricks:

Equipment:
	After a long search, discussion and contemplation with Ramiz. I have agreed that
	Maui Hot Sails Micro Freak is realy good choice for kids ready to plane.
	
	board
		centerboard 
			at the beginning rudder is must. Confidence
		volume
			beginners 		80-110
			intermediate	
	sail
		excellent shape copy of wave sail for grownups, but a lot lighter
		(I admit I had fear for spine 

		Compared to Micro Freak 
		North Sails model Drive Grom looks and feels like wooden rafter/balk,
		while Neil Pryde Dragonfly and One resemble to toilette door mounted on the surfboard
		Personally my wife and myself ride Neil Pryde, but HotSails Maui invests a lot more
		for kids.
		
		good window - clear what kids need (U can see on the fooage)
	
	setup (board and sail combination)		
		cahnge it often... 
		So they would not get used to the same setup.... Remember
		adaptation?

age - able to swim (5y 2m for our youngest daughter Jana)
sail size
	Age			Area [m^2]
	5-6			1.0-1.5
	6-7			1.5-2.0
	7-8			2.5-3.0
	8+			3.0-4.0
	

methodics
	do not use leash - Your kid is not Your dog!
	swim after Your kid. This will give them feeling of beeing secure and 
	boost their confidence
	
	rudder buy board with rudder
