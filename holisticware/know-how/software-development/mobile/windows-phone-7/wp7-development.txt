Let me explain what I mean by .. 'not cross platform' ... The fact is that the WinJS 
library isn't really intended for web development. Unlike jQuery, Prototype, YUI, Dojo etc. 
It's designed to allow web apps (pages) to incorporate Win8 Metro features and functionality. 
Therefore, its not really much help in building sites and pages for browsers others than 
IE10 Metro.
 
The other issue is that many web devs wouldn't touch Windows development with a ten foot 
chopstick! Their focus is the web only ..or .. perhaps making their sites look good on 
mobile browsers .. or .. something like PhoneGap (Adobe) and SenchaTouch.
 
So HTML/CSS/WinJS for building web apps is gonna be a tough sell for non-MS devs.
