Running WinPhone7 emulator inside VMWare 5.01

#For this to work i think you need to have latest generation of processors
#I have tested this on WMWare 5.01 on my MacBook Pro 13", mid 2011
#SPECS:	SSD Vertex3 120GB, 8GB RAM(2 for virtual machine), Intel i7


You need to shut down your VM, after that go to VM settings, Processor&Memory:

	-> increase your ram to 2gb(maybe 1 is also ok)
	-> Under Memory section, Advanced Options:

		-> put checkmark on Enable hypervisor applications in this virtual machine

Start Your VM and voila :)
