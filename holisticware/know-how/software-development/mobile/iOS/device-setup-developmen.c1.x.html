Devices  setup for development

Have you setup your ipad as a development device? If not, plug it in,
run xcode, find the organiser (it's in the window menu I think). In
there, find your ipad in the list and hit "use as a development
device". This adds all the certificates you need to the device.

You will also want to setup auto-download of certificates, in the same
organiser dialog (you login with your developer.apple.com credentials)

A start + crash without obvious reason is usually a certificate issue.

You can also see the console log of the device in the same area in
xcode (it's VERY handy)
