why are you using an adapter are you updating the data?, I would use a 
reader as they are much quicker and then if some of the data needs to be 
updated, native sql update statements to update e.g. update tbldata set 
field1=test where primarykey=1 

or use the orm of sql-net which is quick enough for most things. 

is your data joined in the adapter if so make sure that you have indexes 
on all the relevant fields as this will speed things up.

I've not seen anything on sqlite itself, but you can see the queries
in sqlite-net using the Trace property on the SQLiteConnection class.

Most of the performance problems I've seen is if you use LINQ to get a
big dataset then filter it in memory. I fixed it by using  query so
sqlite was doing the work, not sqlite-net.

My questions are:

    How many records are in the database tables?
    What does the query look like?
    What has an index?


As for suggestions, I agree with Alex on the dataset v. datareader.  Datasets are great in a client server world with multiple users, you can disconnect the results and not have to worry about some type of inadvertent locks.  In the sqlite world, you typically have only 1 query at a time.  Plus, the dr is a tad bit faster depending on the records returned.






This may help, here is Linq to SQLite.
