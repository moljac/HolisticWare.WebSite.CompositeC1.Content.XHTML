can view the bundle by looking in bin\iphone (or which ever you are building), 
find the appname.app - right click and select "show package content"

for ANY .app A .app is just a folder (cd into it in terminal)

.ipa is zip, so you can find an app in itunes, right click and "show in finder". 
Copy (DONT MOVE) the .ipa somewhere (desktop). Rename it .zip. unzip it. and 
then look into the .app... 
the google plus app is interesting, as they have an android-like layout engine in it
