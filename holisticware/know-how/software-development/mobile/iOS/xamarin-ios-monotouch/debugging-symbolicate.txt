debugging-symbolicate

My app has been rejected for crashing. I cannot and have not been able to reproduce what the app store review has described crashes my app.

I have symbolicated the crash logs but not all of the symbols from my code are symbolicated...

Looking around online it seems that other people have this problem and there doesn't seem to be a definitive solution. Or maybe this is just normal?..

The steps that I took to symbolicate are:

1. Copy the Application.app, Application.dSYM and crash reports into the same folder.
2. Open XCode organizer.
3. Go to Device logs and click import.
4. Select the crash files and import them.

I have also run dwarfdump --uuid to confirm that the .app and .dSYM files are the same build.

When I say not all of the symbols are symbolicated what I mean is that only one reference to my code has been symbolicated. Here is a link to the symbolicated file https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5ghoqfnILgZVGJuUElNOGNVQTA

So my questions are:

1. Is this one reference to my code (Thread 0: 17) the problem which is crashing my app?
2. When building the app for the app store in order to get proper symbolicating do I have to select "Enable debugging"?
3. Is there anything that I can do with this crash file to resolve the references that have not been symbolicated?
