		by Packt Publishing

		Initially during reading styling might cause some confusion. Namely each recipe consists of
		(among the others) "How to do it" and "How it works" sections. "How to do it" section explains
		in form of the numbered list steps necessary to accomplish task and "How it works" explains
		the internals of those steps sometimes in the form of numbered list, but not corresponding to
		list in "How to do it" and sometimes in textual free-form. When explaining in the form of
		numbered list smaller off-by-one mistakes happened like on page 50 where item no. 4 explains
		code in item 3.

		Generally for experienced c# and .net programmer those imperfections should not make a big
		difference, because the book is exactly what one might need for transition from Microsoft's
		.net world over to Mono and then to mobile platforms like MonoTouch and/or Mono for Android.
		<br />
		The book does not dive deep into specifics of Mono, what is and what is not implemented
		comparing to Microsoft's .net, but gives steps how to use iOS as mobile platform, its features
		and how to implement those in c# code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book starts with introduction to development tools Xcode and MonoDevelop which might be
		very important for versioned Visual Studio users - especially Xcode usage. This part gives
		appropriate amount of information to start developing iOS applications.
		<br />
		In following chapters author gives overview and steps how to build UI with Views and 
		View Controllers and these chapters are crucial for classical .net developer, because
		they explain iOS UIKit which is different from Microsoft .net UI frameworks like Silverlight,
		WPF, WinForms etc.
		<br />
		Following three chapters deal with bare minimum to start with data management, file system,
		serialization, database support, displaying data and web services.
		<br />
		Chapters 8 through 10 deal with classical mobile smartphone device features like 
		telephony, multimedia, location services with maps and interaction with device 
		hardware (motion, orientation, accelometer and gyroscope). 
		<br />
		Last chapters deal with graphics system and Animations for more compelling UI design
		and development, multitasking, localization and very important subject deploying iOS
		apps.
		<br />
		The book covers Xcode 4 and end up with overview of some of the new features of the iOS 5.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book can be recommended to any experienced developer needing just to start developing
		for iOS devices without diving too deep into internals, although there are enough tips
		and hints in "There's more..." part of each receipt allowing reader to look for more
		information.
		<br />
		
		<br />
		It is important to mention that, for developers with this book at their disposal, all code 
		snippets allow one to write code snippets for Visual Studio without much hassle.
