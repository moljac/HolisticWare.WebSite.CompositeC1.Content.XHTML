	oes your app do any network communication on startup?  If not, the wifi part is probably not helpful,
	that was just Apple telling you under what conditions they were testing

	Hi guys,

	I'm a little confused here. Apple rejected my app with following reason:

	/We found that your app crashed on iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1, which is not
	in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.
	Your app crashed on an unsecured Wi-Fi network
	when we:
	1. Launch the app.
	2. A crash is produced./

	I've tested my app and i have absolutely no crashes on startup. I've tried
	all combinations (debug|iPhoneSimulator, release|iPhoneSimulator, uploaded
	it to my iPhone etc.) and I can't make it crash. I've tried resetting the
	simulator to imitate a clean run - still no crashes.

	My questions are:

	1. The crash log from Apple, how can I get anything usefull out of that
	(it's all machine code)?

	2. What does Apple mean by "Your app crashed on an unsecured Wi-Fi network"
	and how can I test this?

	3. How would you guys proceed?
