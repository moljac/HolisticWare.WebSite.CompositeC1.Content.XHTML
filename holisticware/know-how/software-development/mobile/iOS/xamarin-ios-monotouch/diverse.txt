When I build my project with the iPhoneSimulator configuration, I get:

    missing required architecture i386 in file
/var/folders/0t/z2shp7y529d6zp4_ynqrq6180000gn/T/tmpaa7bdd3.tmp/libMapView.a
(2 slices)

The libMapView.a that you added to the project only contains code for the ARM platform.

You need to create a "fat" binary, one that contains both the code for the ARM platform, 
as well as code for the x86 platform.   You can either request the upstream distribution 
to give you the fat binary, or you 
can build the library yourself by using the "lipo" command to bundle multiple 
architecture-specific binaries into a single file.
