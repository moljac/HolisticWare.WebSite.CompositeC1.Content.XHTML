MT 6 installation


sudo /usr/sbin/installer -pkg ~/Library/Caches/XamarinInstaller/MonoTouch/downloads/monotouch-6.0.0.pkg -target / -verboseR

and attach the output? Please inform of any dialogs you're shown too.

Also, does it help to (re)move your license file (~/Library/MonoTouch/License.v2)?

    cannot update to monotouch 6 because the installer fails at the end.  I
    know there are other posts about this but I thought I would alert you as
    well. It doesn't really tell me anything useful to pass on to you other than
    the install failed.


Contact support@xamarin.com about any installation issues, they can help you.


It would not install for me until I was connected to the internet. Hope this
helps your issue. Mark.


his is a little bit ridicules, I have never had a problem updating monotouch
until this update.  I know i'm not the only one having problems as there are
many posts out there about this install issue.  I contacted xamarin support
and was told to download the packages directly (not through mono develop)
which didn't work any better.  No additional response from them.  Now they
have release 6.0.1, which fails as well.

Xamarin- please take this serious and fix it. 


The release notes for MT 5.4 tell that it is the last version to
support OS X 10.6, so yes, you will have to upgrade.
