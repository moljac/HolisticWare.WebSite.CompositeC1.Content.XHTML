bindings


It looks like your bindings requires CoreGraphics (GC) to be linked in
(and maybe other framework as well).

You can add the list of required frameworks in your [LinkWith]
attribute in your binding project. This will instruct MonoTouch to add
the required (native linking) parameters when building your device
binaries.

note: The default simulator launcher does this automatically (for
every framework) since size does not matter in this case.



I'm assuming you did the binding library:

"/Users/pos/Desktop/binding/VPC_MonoTouch/NextFrameWorkBindingLibrary.dll"

If you expand the static library (.a) you should see a libXXX.linkwith.cs file.
This is where the [LinkWith] attribute is located.

You'll need to add:

Frameworks = "CoreGraphics"

inside it (or add "CoreGraphics" to the list of framework already
present). Other frameworks might also be required.



mhh, the .dll file and .a files are creating automatic with a make file.

Additionally there are 4 *. A * create files
a Universial
an ARMv6
a ARMv7 ...

With what program can expand static librarys?
can integrate the frameworks of default can be automated?


If you're using a Makefile then you're likely not using the new
binding project, which includes LinkWith support.

Try adding:

-gcc_flags="-framework CoreGraphics"

to your project's Options, iPhone Build, inside the "additional mtouch
arguments".

This will do the same as [LinkWith] does (but you'll need to add it to
both Debug and Release options).








ive add the framework now so:

-gcc_flags="-framework CoreGraphics -framework SystemConfiguration
-framework MediaPlayer -framework AudioToolbox -framework CFNetwork
-framework CoreLocation -framework StoreKit"
