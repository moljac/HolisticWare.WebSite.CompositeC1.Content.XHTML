 never seen "pending an apple release"

I've seen "pending DEVELOPER release" - thats when you say "I'll
release it when I want to, not as soon as it's done". You have to go
into itunes connect and release it (good if you are doing PR at the
same time)

Of course, Google says:

""Pending an Apple release" means that the binary was built against a
version of iOS that hasn't been released yet (probably 4.2). You could
try resubmitting with a deployment target of 4.0 if you need to get it
into the store right away."

It's an old answer, but that might be it? Maybe they forgot?
