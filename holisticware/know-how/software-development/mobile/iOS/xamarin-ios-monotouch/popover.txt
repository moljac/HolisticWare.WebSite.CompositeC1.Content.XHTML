PopOVer (PopUp Bubble with Pointer)

Normally those would be done using the UIPopover class, which is part of 
the iOS SDK. However, that class does not work on the iPhone. Apple 
doesn't think you should have popovers like that on the iPhone because 
they don't work very well on a small screen. Some apps (like the facebook 
app) have apparently implemented their own method of doing the same thing. 
If you really want to use one then there are various open source 
reimplementations, but you should also consider doing something else 
instead if your popover is large (I don't consider the Facebook example a 
good UI).

Worked pretty ok for me. May need to tweak it a bit for your specific use.

Hope this helps

This is a custom view/controller similar to the iOS' iPad-only
UIPopoverController.
