his example was taken from one of the MonoTouch books and I had to convert the source code to work on the latest release for MonoTouch.

The original source was referring subView as

this.subView.BackgroundColor = UIColor.LightGray;
And in the process I failed to create an outlet for the view, i.e subView.

If there is no outlet created, the view can be accessed in the following fashion also

this.View.SubViews[0].BackgroundColor = UIColor.LightGray 
and it fixed the problem.
