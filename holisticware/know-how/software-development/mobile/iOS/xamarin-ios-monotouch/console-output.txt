    But aren't device logs disabled in productive builds since some ios5 update?  I thought Console.Write() was changed to a NOP?


What was disabled in iOS5 was stdout/stderr (only redirected to the device console when a device is being used for development), which is not the same as NSLog (always writes to the device console). Console.Write* was changed to use NSLog, not to a NOP.

AFAIK NSLog works always, even for devices never used for development.
