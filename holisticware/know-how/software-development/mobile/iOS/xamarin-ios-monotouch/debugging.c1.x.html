		to get the device console output.

	<h3>Exception Handling</h3>
	<p>
	>      try-catch in my Main, but it didn’t report anything. I need to go back through every piece of code 
	and ensure a try-catch block is in place everywhere – it should be.
	
	In some cases the ObjectiveC exception code plays tricks on MonoTouch and the managed exception handling. 
	An exception handler in Main should catch all exceptions in the main thread (but as you've seen yourself 
	it doesn't quite work in these cases).


	In this case pretty much the only thing left to do is to try to get the device log.
	Would  System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException help to get more info?

	There is no Application class, so no Application.UnhandledException like in Silverlight (MT is superset 
	right?) and no Application.ThreadException
	</p>

	<h3>NSLog</h3>
	<p>
	What was disabled in iOS5 was stdout/stderr (only redirected to the device console when a device
	is being used for development), which is not the same as NSLog (always writes to the device console). 
	<br />
	Console.Write* was changed to use NSLog, not to a NOP.
	<br />
	NSLog works always, even for devices never used for development.

	<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
	<p>
	You cannot catch native signals (_sigtramp and the like) with managed try-catch handlers, once you
	get a native signal something very bad has occurred in the process, and the only sane thing MonoTouch
	can do is to crash. Unfortunately post-mortem debugging of native crashes is quite hard, usually even 
	close to impossible without more information due to the fact that the crash ifself may not be close to 
	the actual bug (you can have a bug that corrupts memory, but not crash until a minute later - 
	at that point it's impossible to know what happened a minute earlier).

	There are two main methods I use to track down these issues:
	* Add lots of logging. Log several times for each method you think is relevant. This 
	  obviously only helps when you're crashing inside your own code.
	* Create a smaller test case. I comment out / remove code until the crash goes away. Then 
	  I re-add code until the crash returns, and try to remove a different part of the code. 
	  Repeat until you've reached a small test case, in which you've either figured out what's 
	  going on, or if you still don't understand it ask someone else 
	  (us for instance, in mailing lists / bugzilla).

	</p>
	<h2>USB and Wifi</h2>
	<p>
	switch between usb and wifi debugging (toggle the checkbox in 
	MonoDevelop's Preferences -> Preferences / Debugger / iPhone Debugger)? 
	Can you also build your project with verbose output (add "-v -v -v" to the 
	additional mtouch arguments in the project's iPhone Build options), and then 
	get the device log (MonoDevelop's menu View -> Pads -> iOS Device Log) 
	from a failed connection?

	<p>
The errors are to do with making calls to the web asynchronously i.e. the error is 
occurring on a different thread to the code that started it, hence your namespace is 
not displayed. 

 

I have experienced the first error when the data being returned was large.  My fix was 
to change my WCF Web API to use paging and then update my RestSharp code (in MonoTouch) 
to make the web calls while passing the paging parameters.  RestSharp is a library that 
simplifies making web calls to REST web services as it automatically serialises the data 
into objects.


I’m using the standard Visual Studio calls to the web client – so if I have a method called 
“Fred” I call “service.Fred()”.I don’t use async, but I do use my own threads so there’s no
 blocking.

 

I’ll look into the response property, but it’s a long slow fix – won’t be till we publish to 
Apple again that I’ll start to get that information, and can then look at fixing it. I can’t 
reproduce these errors, but they’re happening to a few clients in the field.
