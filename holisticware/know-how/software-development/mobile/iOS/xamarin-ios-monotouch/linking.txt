Look at your project's build options and make sure the "Linker
behavior" is at the default "Link SDK assemblies".

If it's showing "Don't link" then you'll experience *very* long build
time (a large part of it in dsymutil).




lso experiencing long build time and I have to clean and rebuild each lib project otherwise the app crashes.

Linker behavior : link sdk assemblies only
Arguments: --linkskip=mscorlib -aot "nimt-trmpolines=512"

Any reason to skip mscorlib.dll ? that's a huge assembly and likely
where a lot of the time is spent.
