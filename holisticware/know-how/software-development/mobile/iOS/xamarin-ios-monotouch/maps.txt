     display a Google Maps view in the app itself and there's also
    functionality to launch the external Maps app. Will either of these work in
    iOS 6?


The API hasn't changed at all, you do it the exact same way you used to with the Google 
maps and in iOS6 it'll use the Apple maps.

In other words: you don't have to do anything at all to make the Apple maps work if you 
already have the Google maps working.
