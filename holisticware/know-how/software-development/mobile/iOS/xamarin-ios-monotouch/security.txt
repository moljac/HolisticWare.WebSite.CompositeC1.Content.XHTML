ave a current application that I will be be expanding on. The current
application has a sqlite db that stores some data and I want to add to it.
The data I am going to add will be sensitive information.  

If the database is in the /Library/ directory, is encryption needed? What
does encrypting the DB stop since everything will be in a sandbox? 

Are there build in ways to encrypt the db? 


Depends on how secure you want it to be - the sandbox (plus curated app store) generally means other applications can never hack at/steal your data, and in the /Library/ folder end-users generally won't find it either.
However, if the phone/device was stolen, unencrypted files are fairly simple for someone to find (eg. using PhoneDisk, doesn't require jailbreaking). So if you want to protect the data even if a phone is lost or stolen, considering encryption is probably a good idea. 

There's nothing "built-in" to Xamarin to do that, but there is a component available to purchase on the store

Yes, if you have sensitive data, then you should use encryption. Maybe your app is in a sandbox, but you dont know if the device has been jailbroken or a bug in the iOS system has been found, so if you want to keep the confidential data confidential, use encryption.

I cant ensure under iOS because i did not used it, but usually, sqlite allows you to encrypt a database just giving a password to the connection before creating the database, in this way, when the db is created its encripted with the given password.

Here you have some examples under .net, maybe those will help you find the way its done on monotouch
