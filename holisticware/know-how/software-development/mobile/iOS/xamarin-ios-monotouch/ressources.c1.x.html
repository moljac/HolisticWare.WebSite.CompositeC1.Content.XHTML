Filenames 
	iOS filenames are case SenSitIvE.

Summary:
	FromBundle
		synchronous.
		can only load images that you include with your application
		provides no built-in caching
	FromFile
		asynchronous
		lazy-loading
		can load images from an external location
		provides automatic cache an image after it is loaded.

usage recommendation:
	use UIImage.FromFile when loading several images at one time, 
	since it lazy-loads images asynchronously.

	use UIImage.FromBundle only when loading the same image repeatedly.
