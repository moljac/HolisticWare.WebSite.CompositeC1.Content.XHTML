As Jason said, you can either use Interface Builder (which is part of
xcode) with C#, or write it in code. Interface builder is really just
building a big object graph, so the result is pretty much the same.

How you do it depends on the app, and you can mix and match as needed.
If you are dealing with lists of data (and if you look closely, most
things on the iPhone ARE lists, see here:
http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Feb-23.html and here:
http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/tutorials/MonoTouch.Dialog ) then learn a
bit about UITableViewController and how it works, then go use
MonoTouch.Dialog, which wraps it all up and makes it really easy to
use. It helps to atleast have a play with UITableViewController /
UINavigationController etc tho, as you then know how the engine works,
so to speak.

Either way, you are going to be using CocoaTouch, which is the same
API as you'd be using from Obj-C. If you have someone working with you
who knows CT, then they are going to be instantly at home (Assuming
they know C#). It's literally the same calls, with a different syntax:

UIView myView;
//init it
// use it....
[myView doSomething:1 withAnotherParameter:@"hello!"];

vrs

UIView myView;
//init it
//use it...
myView.DoSomething(1, "Hello!");

There are often a few differences, but it's more to make it look like
proper c#-style methods. The underlying stuff is the same.
