Speeding-up startup

moving all logic out of the 'FinishedLaunching'
override? You should not be doing expensive initialisation
synchronously for precisely this reason - iOS will kill your app if it
takes too long. For example wrap code in a Task which will execute on
the background thread. You need to ensure you only touch the UI from
your main thread though,

Try switching between wifi and usb debugging. In my own experience
wifi is significantly faster than usb, but that might depend on your
network (so usb might be faster than wifi if your wifi is slow).

Another thing that *might* be a slowdown is if you have *many*
breakpoints set. Try clearing them to see if anything changes (I doubt
it, but it's worth a shot 

Remove refs
What has seemed to help is this: Removing references to System.Data and 
Mono.Data.SqlLite. They were both used in some code, but only code that 
was executed on the server, or in generic code (base libraries) where 
they were no longer needed. So for the code executed on the server 
(same code shared between both projects) I conditionally compiled all 
the System.Data code out of the iPhone side so I could remove the reference. 

This has shaved several seconds off the load time as it’s fewer assemblies 
needing to be loaded. It’s now down to about 12 seconds to start calling 
my code, which takes about 1.5 seconds in total until the “ViewDidAppear”
ends on my first view.

this is why #defs are not good!


Size and speed

out of curiosity, do you have a load of static images being loaded? I
suspect they will get done before the Main loads....

eg:

public static UIImage foo = UIImage.FromBundle("images/foo.png");

might be taking up a bit of time. Clearly whatever it is can be done
in parallel, because the single CPU core speed of the 4 vrs 4S is not
hugely different, - just that the 4S has _two_ of them.

Whats the obj-c thing you are loading? maybe it's spinning up threads?
Does the console in xcode organiser show anything?
