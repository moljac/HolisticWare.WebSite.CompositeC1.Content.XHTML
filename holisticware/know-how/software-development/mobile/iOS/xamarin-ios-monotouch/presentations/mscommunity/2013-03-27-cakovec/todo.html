							Consideration parameters / factors:
							<li>
								*developer expertise -- for a web developer it is easy develop using Cordova + javascript
							</li>
							<li>
								*nature of application (requirements)-- for a resource intensive app, using grahpics and complex, animations,
								better to develop using native SDK
							</li>
							<li>
								*time to market -- you could use Titanium and get the app created to iOS and Android devices
								for sharing code and still maintain native look n feel
							</li>
							<li>
								*resources -- who is available and their past experience, for Titanium you still need to
								understand the platform differences and have the views developed based on the platform

						Which ever approach you choose, you still end up spending more time to handle performance issues
						and handling different device form factors (tablets, phones, bigger screens and high density devices).

						 need closer integration between hardware and software and your
						 App requires to access some massive db somewhere or
						 do a lot of geo-fencing things
						 then always choose "native". Longer build time, but runs faster.

						 Benefit of native apps is that they can be further developed and updated. The cross-platform apps are
						 quicker to create but harder to improve. If you decide on a certain platform, a native application
						 is a better choice.

						 native apps are better and you can achieve more on performance than cross-platform.

						 decision to go with a cross-platform or native app should be tightly linked with the main purpose
						 and functionality of a product.
						
						 It is true that cross-platform version can be cheaper in development but it's more expensive in
						 UI and performance adjustments. So, there is no silver bullet :)

						 Simple APP without too much resource you can build using some cross platform.

							But if your focus it is performance and native resource, without think go to native solution.

						agree with Waldir that it depends up on the features that you want to incorporate in the APP.
						But even Cross-platform frameworks are effective, like IBM Worklight, where you can build apps for
						Android,IOS,Blackberry and Windows in a short span. Development time reduces. And also, if you want
						to incorporate native features, you can use 3rd-party plugins like Apache Cordova which comes inbuilt
						with the framework.

						If you are looking to opt for cross-platform development framework, I would suggest you to go with
						IBM Worklight.



						A hybrid approach using native wrappers and html5 cross platform dynamic content has been successful in our approach. most updates and changes are taken care within the html5 space and dependency on approvals from apple is not required.The native wrappers maintain the look and feel of the respective platforms.


						 It depends what you want to do. For optimal performance using native is best. Vijay and others above make some greats points, above all if you are going cross platform always test on devices. Simulators can have their quirks.


						 Corona. It doesn't impose any platform specific look and feel and I am surprised that the other frameworks do. Is that really true? Also it deals with pretty weighty graphics and mathematical algorithms quite well. I would be interested to hear what your specific performance problem is. Frameworks have moved on quite alot in the last few years and I have noticed that people's opinions may be dragging behind.




						  If you need closer integration between hardware and software and your App requires to access some massive db somewhere or do a lot of geo-fencing things, then always choose "native". Longer build time, but runs faster.

If you dont need all the above, choose "hybrid". Its easy to build, but usually a bit slower.

HTML5 is good when you don't know which screen resolution sizes you would be targeting.

lot of comments here about using frameworks that make cross platform work easier but with tradeoffs. I agree with the comments above that using the SDKs gives you the most flexibility and performance

he barrier to many in using SDKs is the cost and long lead times of development - we get around that through solid and disciplined code development, maintaining code standards and protocols so that our code is reusable, portable and scalable. We have built specialized apps for many industries (food service, Hotels, cinemas, etc) where we can deliver fully native apps on iPhone, Blackberry and Android within a few days, plus if we want to add special functionality, we are only adding that functionality. As always - good coding practices never become obsolete!

The old model of long requirements definition, design documentation, development and testing becomes unnecessary in most circumstances - our code library is already heavily tested (and in use with over 2 million users). It really is custom apps off the shelf.

Back to the issue of Hybrid approaches - there are many reasons to incorporate HTML5 into a native app - sometimes it is the easiest way to integrate a data base (when you have another vendor that is simply not up to the task of a true integration) but it always has tradeoffs and the key performance indicator in an app is always customer experience - Whatever you do, measure it based on customer experience/throughput.



It really depends. Some factors to consider:
- Paid or charging client app
- device (I know iOS reqs tend to prefer more native approach)
- what does the app do? (Music streaming? playing games)
- deadlines (wrapping in html5 takes literally 5 minutes)
- criticality of app (can you test and see which one works best)
- limitations & features (obviously there are limitations to cross platform)

Making the assumption that Native requires traditional development cycles is incorrect.
A well templated native app can take less than an hour across 3 platforms (94% of the market) without the compromises of HTML5 or Titanium.


Joseph makes a good point. The only thing native in the apps developed by my team is the UI. Any of the non-UI / "business logic" like pieces go into a static library written in C++ so that iOS, Android, and Windows UI layers can be built against this library. So in the traditional MVC pattern, the model and most of the controller are abstracted out into the common library. The view and a thin controller are implemented in the platform-specific language. This has helped us develop new features way faster as we need to write the non-UI components just once across all platforms. The amount of savings will depend on how much business logic does you app have, nonetheless you'll definitely save dev / bug fixing cycles.

						<p>
						personal approach for choosing a platform for a specific development is as follows:

						* Determine exactly what platforms you want to reach, iPhone, Android (which version numbers), BlackBerry, WindowsPhone ...

						* Define the requirements that you feel will be the most challenging.

						* Take these requirements and turn them into a few representative screens or UIs. In other words, do a little bit of your app design.

						* Use PropertyCross ( http://www.propertycross.com ) to help select a few frameworks that you think might work for you, in that they deliver a user experience you are happy with and that the tools / language are suitable for your development team.

						* Prototype your application using the frameworks you want to test out.

						* Place these prototypes in the hands of your users, stakeholders, developers - your wife and mother-in-law. See what the users reaction is to each framework.

						* Take a view on delivered user experience versus cost for each frameworks.

						* Choose one and go for it!

						Prototyping with a few frameworks might sound costly, but with so many options, each of which are quite different, I feel it is the only way to be sure you have made the right decision. Making the wrong decision can be very costly. You don't want to do a 'Facebook' and have to throw away your whole application because you are the wrong choice!

						Finally, in step (4) above make sure you also consider native and non HTML5-based frameworks (Xamarin, Titanium, AdobeAir). HTML5 is not the only way to make a cross-platform application!
