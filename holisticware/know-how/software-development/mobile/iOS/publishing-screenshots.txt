f you are updating your app for iPhone 5 and iPod touch (5th 
generation), you must provide additional screenshots to support the new 
screen dimensions for the App Store. 

The new screenshot dimensions are: 

640 x 1136 (portrait) 
640 x 1096 (portrait) 
1136 x 640 (landscape) 
1136 x 600 (landscape) 

To deliver new screenshots, go to the Version Details page in the Manage 
Your Applications module on iTunes Connect. 

If you deliver a new app binary that takes advantage of the new screen 
size for iPhone 5 or iPod touch (5th generation) without screenshots in 
the new dimensions, the status of your app will change to Missing 
Screenshot. Your app will not be reviewed until you upload screenshots 
with the correct dimensions. You will also need to upload screenshots 
for any added localizations you have set up on iTunes Connect. 

For more information on screenshot requirements, see the Asset 
Specifications section in the iTunes Connect Developer Guide.
