In addition to the couple of extra certificates (on the apple
developer provisioning site:

https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action

(login first), under Certificates -> Development)x

you can also (in xcode) open the organiser (window -> Organiser) and
if you go into provisioning, and hit the refresh button, it'll ask for
your login (apple developer id), and download most of what you need -
team profile, any app-specific certs etc. Also handy if you change a
profile or update anything in the dev provisioning area.
