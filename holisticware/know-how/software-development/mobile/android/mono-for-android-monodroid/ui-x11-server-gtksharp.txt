I wonder if there is a way to get these apps. on android by using monodroid or do i have 
to use android.sdk?

Short version: No, you should use Mono for Android or the Android SDK.

Long version: There is no GTK+ backend to target Android (afaik). Even if there were, 
you'd likely need to redo all your layout.

The only way to make this work would be to run an X11 server on the device, and use the 
normal GTK+ X11 backend. (There _are_ X11 servers on the Android store, so this isn't 
impossible... Possibly insane, or a _great_ April Fools hack [0], but not impossible...)

There are two problems with this approach:

1. The Mono for Android assemblies are not fully compatible with desktop .NET. They're a 
superset of Silverlight, so large swaths of classes are missing (e.g. System.Configuration). 
It may not be possible to run a Gtk# app unchanged w/o recompiling all of Gtk# and your application.

2. A desktop app + X11 will be a _terrible_ user experience.

The sane approach is to separate out your app logic from your GUI code (MVC/MVVM/etc. 
come in handy here), "port" your core app logic onto Mono for Android, and write a new 
GUI using Android-native types. This is the approach take by apps such as 
TouchDraw, iCircuit, and Rdio:

Pity the screenshots & source are no longer compatible; it was a GTK+ 2.0 backend for 
curses support, allowing you to run GTK+ apps on a console w/o a framebuffer or X11.
