Interesting. I hadn't seen those process sizes before...

So, as a "walkthrough", let's consider the Hello World sample:

	https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/HelloWorld

I've got it running on an x86 emulator and a Galaxy Nexus; alas, not all of what follows applies to both...

So, as per Settings > Apps > Running > Show Cached Processes > mono.samples.helloworld, the Galaxy Nexus states that the process is 8.7MB in size, while the x86 emu says it's 8.8MB.

PS output: x86:

	$ adb -e shell ps | grep hellowo
	app_55    1451  779   207184 31596 ffffffff b7ed8ed7 S mono.samples.helloworld

PS output: ARM:

	$ adb -d shell ps | grep hellowo
	u0_a99    28904 124   486732 34176 ffffffff 00000000 S mono.samples.helloworld

What are we looking for?

	$ adb -e shell ps -p 1451
	USER PID PPID VSIZE RSS PRIO NICE RTPRI SCHED WCHAN PC NAME
	app_55 1451 779 207184 31596 20 0 0 3 ffffffff b7ed8ed7 S mono.samples.helloworld

 The 4th column is VSIZE, while the 5th column is RSS (Resident Set Size); sizes are in KB. Thus, on each platform there's ~31-34MB in RSS, which (1) sounds huge, and (2) is quite different from what the Settings app is reporting.

Want more detailed memory use? Check /proc/PID/status:

x86 (abbreviated):

	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/status
	Name:	ples.helloworld
	State:	S (sleeping)
	VmPeak:	  208684 kB
	VmSize:	  207184 kB
	VmLck:	       0 kB
	VmHWM:	   33068 kB
	VmRSS:	   31596 kB
	VmData:	   32192 kB
	VmStk:	      84 kB
	VmExe:	       8 kB
	VmLib:	   51088 kB
	VmPTE:	     160 kB

ARM:

	$ adb -d shell cat /proc/28904/status
	Name:	ples.helloworld
	State:	S (sleeping)
	VmPeak:	  491164 kB
	VmSize:	  486732 kB
	VmLck:	       0 kB
	VmHWM:	   37572 kB
	VmRSS:	   34176 kB
	VmData:	   28340 kB
	VmStk:	     136 kB
	VmExe:	       8 kB
	VmLib:	   29736 kB
	VmPTE:	     130 kB
	VmSwap:	       0 kB

Certainly more human readable than `ps` output, but I still have no idea where the 8MB is coming from. Bizarre...

Regardless, those numbers are still _huge_. Where's all the memory _going_?

This is where the unlocked hardware falls down: /proc/PID/smaps has the desired information, but it's not accessible on unrooted devices:

	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/smaps
	08048000-0804a000 r-xp 00000000 1f:00 464        /system/bin/app_process
	Size:                  8 kB
	Rss:                   4 kB
	Pss:                   0 kB
	Shared_Clean:          4 kB
	Shared_Dirty:          0 kB
	Private_Clean:         0 kB
	Private_Dirty:         0 kB
	Referenced:            4 kB
	Swap:                  0 kB
	KernelPageSize:        4 kB
	MMUPageSize:           4 kB
	...
	0877d000-08ab1000 rw-p 0877d000 00:00 0          [heap]
	Size:               3280 kB
	Rss:                3280 kB
	Pss:                2331 kB
	Shared_Clean:          0 kB
	Shared_Dirty:       1000 kB
	Private_Clean:         0 kB
	Private_Dirty:      2280 kB
	Referenced:         2392 kB
	Swap:                  0 kB
	KernelPageSize:        4 kB
	MMUPageSize:           4 kB
	...

It's...huge. You'll certainly want to redirect that to a file. 

What you'll find is that _most_ of the memory is being used by "data" -- shared libraries, fonts, etc. What's interesting is the "Private_Dirty" and "Shared_Dirty" values; let's sum them up:

	# sanity check; note that the value is fairly close to the previous VmPeak size in the /proc/PID/status output
	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/smaps | grep Size | awk '{ sum += $2 } END {print sum " kB"}'
	209112 kB

	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/smaps | grep Private_Dirty | awk '{ sum += $2 } END {print sum " kB"}'
	4212 kB

	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/smaps | grep Shared_Dirty | awk '{ sum += $2 } END {print sum " kB"}'
	15036 kB

	# sanity; note that Private_Dirty+Shared_Dirty = Dirty
	$ adb -e shell cat /proc/1451/smaps | grep Dirty | awk '{ sum += $2 } END {print sum " kB"}'
	19248 kB

So ~4MB is private/unshared, and ~15MB is private/shared. There's nothing that can be done about the Shared_Dirty mappings (it's due to ld.so/etc.), so out of the original ~32MB RSS value, only 4MB was actually written to between Android & Mono for Android (for this process).

I'm still not sure where the Settings app is getting 8MB from, but it appears to have no relation to any of the above information...
