In short, library project resources are supported when you zip relevant library 
project build results (in "bin" directory in the Java project) and embed it as 
"LibraryProjectZip" in a Java binding library project. 



The library resource IDs should appear in the Resource.designer.cs like the 
resources in the pplication's own resources, but with some remarks, which is a 
bit tricky... Let me explain how it works.

The resources in the library project are embedded in the library project binding 
dll, and they are expanded when you *build* the application that references the 
library project.
In the build step, it collects the resources and generates Resrouce.designer.cs 
(like we do for usual resources). *At that stage*, you should be able to reference 
the resource IDs for the library project resources, like other resource IDs. 
(This "fist-time-missing" issue is somewhat itchy, but not very serious I assume.)

We have a sample for this Android Library Project support, as a Facebook SDK 
binding sample.

In this sample ("simple"), you can e.g. reference  "Resource.Drawable.close" 
image from the library project jar, not in the app project.
