	[0] Tracing is problematic as it's not fully stable on ARM, and thus not entirely dependable, 
	e.g. I've seen OverflowExceptions generated strictly because tracing is enabled.

	Ideally you should minimize what gets traced; see the --trace docs at:

	http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=man%3amono(1)

	</pre>
	
	Diagnostics
	Enable
	   adb shell setprop debug.mono.env MONO_LOG_LEVEL=info
	   adb shell setprop debug.mono.log gref,gc

	Discable
	Just set them to the empty string:

	adb shell setprop debug.mono.env ''
	adb shell setprop debug.mono.log ''	






	
	Any chance you can try running on a Jelly Bean target? It's possible that mono 
	is writing a message to stderr, and Jelly Bean (finally!) copies 
	stdout/stderr messages to logcat...

	Otherwise, if you can easily reproduce this I'd suggest enabling runtime tracing 
	to see where it gets before things die:

	# http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/diagnostics
	adb shell setprop debug.mono.trace all

Note: tracing is known to be not entirely stable, particularly around System.Net...














Serious help needed - I really haven't a clue what's going on

I updated the android-sdk-windows   - cant really recall what exactly changed in 
that update but since then when I run a build I get

"aapt.exe" exited with code one

Pointing to line 460 in  Novell.Monodroid.Common.Targets

e.g these lines

<!-- Run aapt to generate R.java -->

	   <Aapt

			  AndroidSdkDirectory="$(_AndroidSdkDirectory)"

			  JavaPlatformJarPath="$(JavaPlatformJarPath)"

 

 

It is the AndroidSDKDirectory it seems to fail on

I have un installed the android-sdk-windows    and reinstalled it  ( a painful task if 
ever there was one)

I've checked the path to the Androdi-sdk-windows in VS2010 - no issue there

As its all tied up with Java its not as if I can revert to a previous version of the  
sln file either

 

Can anyone help  - I'm desperate






Enable diagnostic MSBuild output: 
Tools > Options... > Projects and Solutions > Build and Run > MSBuild project build output verbosity: Diagnostic

Clean + Rebuild your solution.

The MSBuild output is visible in View > Output pad. Look through the MSBuild output and look 
for "aapt"; the actual aapt-generated error should be (somewhere) in there. What is it?


Thanks Jonathan
The error was - it was objecting to a graphics file which had spaces in  the
name.
You might ask why this worked on previous builds? Well I remember once just
after updating the android-sdk using monodevelop instead of VS2010.
It appears that MonoDevelop has changed the build flags on several files
from none to content or build.
The offending graphics file was not part of this project but had acquired
content flag.	


	<h2>Debugging</h2>
	
	<p>
		If in project file  (.csproj), the Debug <PropertyGroup/> section contains:
	</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;AndroidUseSharedRuntime&gt;False&lt;/AndroidUseSharedRuntime&gt;
	&lt;EmbedAssembliesIntoApk&gt;True&lt;/EmbedAssembliesIntoApk&gt;

	</pre>
	<p>
	That will disable the shared runtime, slow down app reinstall/turnaround, 
	and in general isn't recommended for Debug builds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even JP had no answer:
		have to wonder if debugging requires the shared runtime. I don't know... :-/
	</p>
	<p>
		Some people report can debug release builds (non shared runtime) on my device 
		(barring the constant debugger timeouts).
	</p>


	<p>
		Release app with the shared runtime enabled, which is not a supported configuration
	</p>
