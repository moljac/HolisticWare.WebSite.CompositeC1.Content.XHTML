What may be the problem is that Android is destroying you singleton class. Android does not ensure that static classes/members will keep their values. On lower end devices, the garbage collector is obviously working hard to keep memory usage at a minimum.

If you wish to do something like this, you can create an instance of whatever class, and assign it to a member on a derived Application.

I also had this problem with my application, so I changed the class to be an instance class. I then created a class that derived from Android.App.Application (remember the [Application] attribute). And in the application's OnCreate, I created an instance of my no-longer-static class. This did help.

You can then access you Application by using (MyApplication)Context.ApplicationContext.

Hope this is useful (and if inaccurate, please don't hesitate to inform me)

	Hi
	I have been getting random null reference exceptions in my app when running
	on lower end devices (galaxy ace in this case), but not on a desire s or
	emulators.  They mostly seem to be in and around my data access to sqlite
	(using sqlite-net) although I haven't been able to pin point them to any one
	bit of code.  Generally it will crash with the only stacktrace being that
	there was a null reference exception and nothing to indicate where and so I
	have been using logging to try to get an idea of the source of the issues
	but it seems to shift around.  Then today the debugger actually caught one
	of these occurences but when checking out the variables in scope 'this' was
	null (I have a screen shot if you would like it as in theory this isn't
	possible).  'this' being a singleton instance of a class which was running
	some data updates on a background thread (started from my activity using
	ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(state => _dp.CheckCacheAge()); ).  At this
	point there is not a lot going on in the current activity which is simply
	waiting on the updates and has some event handlers attached to update the ui
	with progress.  This particular crash happened at a point where there is not
	a great deal loaded into memory.

	stacktrace:

	System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an
	object
	at (wrapper stelemref) object:virt_stelemref_class (intptr,object)
	 at MyDevon.DataProvider.PopulateConfiguration () [0x0001b] in

	The log from another occurence (included last reference to garbage
	collection):

	These crashes are intermitent as in they do not occur in the same place each
	time and only occur roughly 1 in every 3 runs of the full update routine.
	There doesn't seem to be any correlation with timings of the GC either, but
	it does feel like something external is killing off my static instance of
	this class.

	Any advice of where to look on this one would be very helpful as I'm
	completely at a loss.
