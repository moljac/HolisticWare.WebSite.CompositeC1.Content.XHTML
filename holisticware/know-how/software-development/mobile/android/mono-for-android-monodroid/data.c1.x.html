Can you provide an Activity constructor which takes parameters? Yes. Would it be at all helpful? No, because Activities are started through Context.StartActivity(), which provides no mechanism to invoke a non-default constructor.

The "Android Way" to transfer data between Activities is to use the Intent "extras" mechanism, e.g. Intent.PutExtra(string,string) and Intent.GetStringExtra(string), which introduces it's own set of problems:

Intents are also an IPC mechanism (as an Activity may actually reside in another process -- this is by design), so you're restricted to types which can be marshaled across process boundaries.
Strings, ints, and other builtin types are supported, but aren't exactly "high level" objects.
"Higher level" objects are supported through the android.os.Parcelable interface, but (a) has a "marshal by value" semantic, so isn't useful for sharing read+write data between activities, and (b) Mono for Android doesn't currently support implementing this interface.
So how do you share data between Activities? By punting.

Place the data onto an Application subclass. This will be accessible via the Context.ApplicationContext property, and can store process-global state.
Use some other public static field within your process to contain the shared information.
Provide a ContentProvider implementation which will store and provide the desired data when prompted.
Sqlite?
etc.


e json serialization and attach the resulting string as Intent Extras. For this you need to decorate the Class you want to serialize with [DataContract] attribute and Class Fields with [DataMember]. 
On the receiving activity you can again use json deserialization to construct the object. 




In Activity 1 I tried this: 
>                        var intent = new Intent(this.BaseContext, new HelloTabWidget().Class);
>                        intent.AddFlags(ActivityFlags.NewTask);
> 
>                        Bundle bun = new Bundle();
>                        *bun.PutSerializable("test", (BaseData)dat);  *
> 
>                        intent.PutExtras(bun);
>                        StartActivity(intent);
> 
> The bold line won´t work

PutSerializable() wants a Java.IO.ISerializable, which (1) BaseData doesn't implement, and  (2) you
can't currently implement from managed code anyway. (java.io.Serializable requires that you
implement private readObject() and writeObject() methods, which you can't currently do in Mono for Android.)

Thus, there are two workarounds:

 1. If Activity2 is in your process, store the BaseData object reference in a global variable somewhere and
just read it from Activity2.
 2. If Activity2 isn't in your process (or using globals is "evil"), then serialize BaseData to a string
(XML?) and send the string to Activity2.





If Activity2 is in your process, store the BaseData object reference in a
global variable somewhere and just read it from Activity2. 
Since I have to finish a small demonstration app this would be ok. 

I´ve tried to define a public variable in activity1. But I had no luck to
access this from activity2. 

Could you please give me a very short example on how to do that?
