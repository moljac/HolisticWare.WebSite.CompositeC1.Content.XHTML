Hi

Because of designer I'm using MonoDevelop more and more and came accross deploying/licensing
question again.

According to
	http://support.xamarin.com/customer/portal/articles/177037-can-i-use-my-license-on-more-than-one-machine-

It is a bit unclear whether the same license can be used from VS and MD...

So if Visual-Studio centric person registers license in VS deploying from
MonoDevelop cannot be done or am I wrong?

regards
