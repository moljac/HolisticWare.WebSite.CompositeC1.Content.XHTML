Installation problems - 
	
	Symptoms:
	Check your Android SDK path, if it's not located in "C:\android-sdk-windows" you 
	might encounter this problem.

	Moving it there might resolve, I've had issues with capitalisation on layouts also.. 
	good luck!

	
	Causes:
	
	Compile errors:
	 Error 1 The "Novell.MonoDroid.Build.Tasks.AndroidComputeResPaths" task could not be loaded 
	 from the assembly C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Novell\Novell.MonoDroid.Build.Tasks.dll. 
	 Could not load file or assembly 'Mono.Cecil, Version=0.9.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=0738eb9f132ed756' 
	 or one of its dependencies.
	
	Solution:
		uninstall MfA.
		Delete the  MSBuild/Novell directory.
		cclean
		Reinstall MfA.
