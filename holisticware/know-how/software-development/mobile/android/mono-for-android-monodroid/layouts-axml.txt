       I have a class in my project that is a widget. I know I can use it in code as a workaround but can I use it in axml as well? If so, how do I configure it?

The monodroid list [0] or the forums [1] would be a better place to ask.

To refer to a type in a .axml file, you must use either the fully-qualified C# type name (case-sensitive), or the fully-qualified Android Callable Wrapper type name [2, 3]:

    https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/blob/master/GLCube/Resources/layout/main.xml#L21
    https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/blob/master/GLCube/PaintingView.cs#L16

The above sample is old, so it's using the Android Callable Wrapper type name, but it could instead use the fully-qualified C# type name instead:

    <Mono.Samples.GLCube.PaintingView
            android:id="@+id/paintingview"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    />
