Correct:

Unfortunately Visual Studio doesn't provide a setting to change this.
MonoDevelop does, and both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop use the same preference location:

1. Start MonoDevelop
2. Tools > Options...
3. In the left pane, select Other > SDK Locations
4. In the right pane, alter the Java SDK (JDK) entry.
5. Click OK.

You may need to restart Visual Studio for the change to be apparent.
