I installed the 4.2.8 update yesterday.  After the update was finished, my
Mono For Android install was no longer activated.  I downloaded my license
file and put it in the below locations, but Visual Studio and MonoDevelop
both still say I'm using the evaluation version and ask me to activate it
when I try to deploy to my device.  I'd rather not recycle a workstation and
reactivate if it's possible (I might not have any recycles left.)  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

I wasn't sure where the license file was supposed to go, but I tried both of
the following locations:
C:\Documents and Settings\thomas.replogle\Local Settings\Application
Data\Xamarin\Mono for Android\License
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mono for
Android\License


license underneath Environment.GetFolderPath (Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData), 
which I believe should be:

	%ProgramData%\Mono for Android\License\monoandroid.licx.

On Windows 8 (my easily accessible Windows box), this is:

	C:\ProgramData\Mono for Android\License\monoandroid.licx

Based on the paths you're providing, I suspect you're on XP, so it looks like the 
filename should be:

	C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mono for Android\License\monoandroid.licx

Is your license named monoandroid.licx in the correct directory?



Console.WriteLine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData))
in LINQPad just to make sure I was using the correct folder.  It returned
"C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data" which is the
directory I'm using.

My license filename is monoandroid.licx.

Here is the full path I'm using:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mono for
Android\License\monoandroid.licx

Side note: I've also tried the following path, but it didn't work either.
C:\Documents and Settings\thomas.replogle\Application Data\Mono for
Android\License\monoandroid.licx


 recycled one of my activations on my Xamarin Store account, deleted my
local license files, and then tried to reactivate my local install. 
However, nothing happens when I press the "Activate" button in the
activation window (the one where you fill in your name, activation code,
company name, and phone number.)  The mouse cursor changes to an hourglass
for a few seconds, then back to an arrow, and the activation window just
stays there.  Mono for Android is still showing as not activated.
