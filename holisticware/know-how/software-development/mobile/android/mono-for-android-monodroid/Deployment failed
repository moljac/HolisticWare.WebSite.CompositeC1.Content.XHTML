Deployment failed. 
Internal error

Can you provide Diagnostic build output?

Within MonoDevelop/OS X:

	• Click MonoDevelop > Preferences...
	• In the left-hand tree view, select Preferences > Build
	• In the right-hand panel, set the Log verbosity drop-down to Diagnostic
	• Click OK
	• Restart MonoDevelop
	• Clean and rebuild your package.

It will also be helpful to view the $HOME/Library/Logs/MonoDevelop-3.0/AndroidTools*.log file.

or what it's worth, I'm using the same version of the both and I also
periodically get deployment errors too ("deployment failed"); usually
I just restart monodevelop and the problem disappears though.


Another place to look for error messages is in the AndroidTools log files:

	Windows:
		%LOCALAPPDATA%\MonoDevelop-3.0\Logs\AndroidTools-DATE.log

	OSX:
		$HOME/Library/Logs/MonoDevelop-3.0/AndroidTools-DATE.log

This is usually similar in nature to:

	http://docs.xamarin.com/android/troubleshooting#INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK_when_installing_a_package

You'll need to obtain the logcat output to see _why_ Android doesn't like your AndroidManifest.xml:

	http://docs.xamarin.com/Android/Guides/Deployment%2C_Testing%2C_and_Metrics/Android_Debug_Log

	
	
	      I also encountered this and found that it is because of wrong
package name. If my package name does not have a .[dot] like
HelloWorld then it complains, but if I change my package name to
Mvp.HelloWorld, then it works fine.

       I am not sure whether you are also having the same problem?
