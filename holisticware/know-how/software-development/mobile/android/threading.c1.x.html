		Are you doing this heavy lifting on the UI thread? 
		You can't do anything like that there; the OS will kill you after a certain period of unresponsiveness. 
		If you're doing it on a background thread, are you accessing the UI thread from your 
		background thread without using RunOnUIThread? Mono for Android crashes 
		if you do that without any warning (see the bug list). 
		Also, the debugger has major issues with catching exceptions in background threads. 
		You're best to put in some breakpoints there or move your code 
		temporarily to the UI thread whilst resolving issues with it.

	A guess is that you're using too much memory. 
	You might try logging the value of System.GC.GetTotalMemory() to see how much you're using; 
	perhaps your DB can't all be fit into RAM at once, and the Linux kernel is nuking your process 
	from orbit for using too much memory.

	If that's the case, the only solution is to use less memory, e.g. have more 
	DB inserts so that fewer rows are kept in memory at once.
