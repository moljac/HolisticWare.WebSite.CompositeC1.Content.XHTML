	Can't understand when to choose "Sdk Assamblies only" or "Sdk and User Assamblies" 
	in project configuration?

	Mono.Android.GoogleMaps.dll is an SDK assembly, and it's being improperly linked, 
	so there's no real difference between those options here.

	The problem is that due to a bug (oversight), Mono.Android.GoogleMaps.dll isn't 
	linked the same was as Mono.Android.dll is, causing too much to be removed.

	Try disabling linking of Mono.Android.GoogleMaps.dll by using linkskip support:

	http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/linking#linkskip
	http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/build_process#Mandroid_Arguments

	<pre class="hw_code">
	<PropertyGroup>
		<AndroidLinkMode>Mono.Android.GoogleMaps</AndroidLinkMode>
	</PropertyGroup>
	</pre>

		Scenario:
 - bug in app causes a crash and Android re-starts the app
 - during the re-start the app de-serialises some stored data but this
fails, for example when de-serialising XmlElement. The same code works fine
most of the time.

It seems as though during the re-start some of the assemblies that are
usually "hanging around" (technical term) aren't there. So code like:

string typeName = "XmlElement";
Type type = GetType(typeName);
XmlSerializer s = new XmlSerializer(type);

would fail. Simply adding in the assembly name to help out the serialiser
will work:

string typeName = "XmlElement, System.Xml";

Hope this saves somebody some time one day!
