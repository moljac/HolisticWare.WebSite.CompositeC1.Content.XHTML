Can you provide an `Activity` constructor which takes parameters? 
Yes. 

Would it be at all helpful? 
No, because Activities are started through Context.StartActivity() [0], 
which provides no mechanism to invoke a non-default constructor.

The "Android Way" to transfer data between Activities is to use the Intent 
"extras" mechanism, e.g. Intent.PutExtra(string,string) [1] and 
Intent.GetStringExtra(string) [2], which introduces it's own set of problems:

1. Intents are also an IPC mechanism (as an Activity may actually reside in 
another process -- this is by design), so you're restricted to types which
can be marshaled across process boundaries.
2. `String`s, `int`s, and other builtin types are supported, but aren't 
exactly "high level" objects.
3. "Higher level" objects are supported through the android.os.Parcelable [3] 
interface, but 
(a) it has a "marshal by value" semantics, so isn't useful for sharing read+write 
data between activities, and 
(b) Mono for Android doesn't currently support implementing this interface [4].

So how do you share data between Activities? By punting.

* Place the data onto an Application[5] subclass. This will be accessible via 
the Context.ApplicationContext [6] property, and can store process-global state.

* Use some other `public static` field within your process to contain the shared 
information.

* Provide a ContentProvider [7] implementation which will store and provide the 
desired data when prompted.

* Sqlite?

* Serialize to a string and transfer the sring

* etc.

The launched activity can then use the Bundle parameter passed to OnCreate() to 
extract the Intent data.
