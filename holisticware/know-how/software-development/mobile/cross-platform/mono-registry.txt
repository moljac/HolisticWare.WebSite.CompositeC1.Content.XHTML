know Mono emulates the registry using a file structure in
/etc/mono/registry, as well as .mono/registry in the user's home directory
for user keys, and am trying to find what to replace "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" etc
with, as all I get is a crash report saying it doesn't start with a valid
registry root.

I have tried "CurrentUser", "~/.mono/registry/CurrentUser", and various
other combos, as well as converting to lower case.  I still get the invalid
registry root error message.

What do I need to replace HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT etc with
to get it to pick up data from the registry folders?




This is the only file in my ~/.mono/registry directory.  
~/.mono/registry/CurrentUser/software/classes/code/shell/open/command/values.xml

Have you tried creating a trivial program to write to HKEY_CURRENT_USER? 
Does this trivial program work on other platforms?
