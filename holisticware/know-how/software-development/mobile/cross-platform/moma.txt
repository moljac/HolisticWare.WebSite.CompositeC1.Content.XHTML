The tool to generate the definition files is in github:
https://github.com/mono/moma/tree/master/MoMAExtractor

You will need to update AssemblyManager.cs to point to both the .NET and 
Mono assemblies.  You might also want to update to .NET 4.5.

After that, you put them in a zip file with a little bit of metadata and 
they're ready.  (See existing definition packs.)

I am guessing if you put them somewhere for Xamarin, they can upload 
them to the definition update web service.
