Fragments

	Mono for Android supports Fragments, both in the Honeycomb incarnation and in the 
	Support incarnation. If you want to target Android v2.2, you'll need to reference 
	Mono.Android.Support.v4.dll:
	
Tabs

	kes sense that it should do this, but I want to keep the tabs at the
bottom because I'm porting from an iOS app which uses a UITabBarController.
I've probably just missed something very obvious.

Can anyone post an example on how I could go about this?


ok a few things you should know about android.

Each intent has it's own contentview. So if you want tabs on each intent, you have to
make your content view set on each intent. You might be thinking of a viewflipper or 
the like which, though annoying to set up, is what I think you want.


Tabs in android are at the top of the screen. My suggestion is to follow the native format 
as users are used to this. You should also look at the fragmenttabspager demo 
https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/blob/master/Support4/Support4/Activities/FragmentTabsPager.cs. 
I believe tabs at bottom is custom


view flipper or a carousel style interface

My app is a drill-down app with a lot of data and a lot of nested ListViews,
so it's crucial that the navigation is good so people can get to info
quickly and logically.

I've been working with ActivityGroup, although I know that it is deprecated.
I have it working but it's still a little buggy when navigating back, but
I'm sure I can fix that.

I thought of using fragments but my target Android version is 2.2 (Froyo)
and above and I read that Mono for Android doesn't support fragments in
anything under 3.0 (yet).

I would have thought it was simpler to implement having a set of tabs
positioned either top or bottom, which would act as global navigation and be
available on each Activity.
