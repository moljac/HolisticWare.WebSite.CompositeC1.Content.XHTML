eveloped an app using both Monodroid (and Monotouch) and now I have to
add push notifications for both of them. I am new to mobile app development
and to push notifications services and I would like to know if someone has
implemented push notifications in a Monodroid app and how you went about it.
I've found some solutions online :

1. urban air ship  http://urbanairship.com <http://urbanairship.com>  
2. push sharp  https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp
<https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp>  

Which have you used?
Which do you recommend?


Go PushSharp way, you can find more info here

http://blog.xamarin.com/2012/08/13/push-notifications-introduction-to-pushsharp-seminar/

and here

https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp/wiki/How-to-Configure-&-Send-GCM-Google-Cloud-Messaging-Push-Notifications-using-PushSharp

on how to implement them.



implemented push notifications by using a long polling strategy.

long polling works by making a request with no timeout. The webserver will only reply when there is something to deliver. Though It is convenient to have a 5 to 8 minute timeout as some mobile operators tend to drop idle connections.


Have you ever run into an issue with the number of concurrent connections to
the webserver? I'm performing long polls instead of push notifications
myself, and I'm experiencing some weird issues when I can suddenly no longer
make a HttpWebRequest to my server and seeing as per default Android allows
2 concurrent connections to the same address I suspect that I might be
hitting that limit every now and then.


I can confirm this... max 2 concurrent connections is allowed. If another one is done, it's blocked until one of the previous is released.
I didn't notice this before because I didn't have (previously) any situation where more than 2 connections were made.
Is this an Android limitation or a bug in MfA?

nub, please :D

I've done some googling, the best I could find was this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4654480/android-httpclient-perfomance -
according to this, it's an Android limitation. It would be nice to have some
official confirmation, though - perhaps Jon could chime in?

I'm also not sure how it is decided what is the same host... if it's the
same fqdn, or if it's IP based (if it's the former, in my case I could work
around it by using the ip address in the long poll and have two more
requests for user initiated stuff).

Then I found this:
http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/params/ConnPerRouteBean.html

which seems to suggest it should be possible to change the value - though
I'm not at all familiar with java interop at this point.

If you do go down that route and find it working, I'd be much obliged if you
could share the solution.

For my part, I've started (already had some in place) to be extremely strict
in enforcing that only one request runs on top of my long poll, and I
diligently abort my long poll requests if I see a network issue reported
anywhere (from connection manager or my "is server reachable" process) in
the hope that this could bring an end to my "happens every now and then but
I don't have a method to reliably reproduce" issues where every new http
request I make reports a timeout even though the server is perfectly
reachable.


his solved my problem

System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit = 4;

The default value is 2.

Thanks for the suggestion.
Have you successfully implemented PushSharp in your app. If so: 

1. how many active users does the app have?
2. how many notifications are you sending out each day?


Has anyone implemented push sharp in their monodroid application?
If so, can you please post a tutorial on how do this ?


Have you already looked at the examples available on github?
