If these are precompiled assemblies (i.e. you didn't build them yourself), this is 
unadvisable, and liable to blow up. Mono for Android is a distinct "profile," not entirely 
compatible with "regular" .NET. In the same way that you couldn't intermix .NET 3.5 
assemblies and Silverlight 3 assemblies, you can't safely intermix Mono for Android 
assemblies with anything that wasn't compiled against the Mono for Android assemblies.

For example, if you use an assembly that uses System.Configuration, or System.Windows.Forms, 
it WILL fail on device, as those assemblies don't exist.

Same problem: Mono for Android doesn't provide a Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assembly, 
so your VB.NET assembly can't be used. Furthermore, you can't use 
Microsoft's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assembly, as it wasn't compiled against the 
Mono for Android assemblies, so it would likely fail to load at runtime.

Unfortunately you can't use VB.NET-generated assemblies with Mono for Android 
at this time.
