Peter Shaw • Definitely an interesting question it has to be said.

However, I'm going to turn it on it's head a little bit:

I have a huge amount of different tools, and it really depends on what my current 
project is, as to what I use.

Common tools however? well there are a few, VS2010 for starters gets used in just 
about everything.

SMSS is another.

but then your getting into the realm of graphics vs code. If I'm doing design work, then Photoshop, Flash and many others feature, if it's SQL then depends on the DB in use, but I use things like PGAdmin SQNavigator and NaviCat, if it's C# then lots of .NET related tools like Resharper.

The point here is, there is NO universal tool set, a good developer should be able to use everything, and more appropriately should know what to use, why to use it and when.

Vijaya Kumbaji • @Peter,

My answer would be same as Peter Shaw's above , I would agree with him in all lines. I have worked on so many different contract jobs and had to learn new technical skill (sometimes more than one skill) at each of the client project. So even I have developed .NET application with different technologies but .NET, VS 2008,2010, 2012 and SQL Server 2008, 2010 and now 2012 being core development tools. 
Now I am working on MVC 4 with MVVM and KnockoutJS tools. KnockoutJS, KendoUI MVC and MVVM is new for me.

Zijian Huang • Nice list. Excellent attitude of sharing and approaching laziness. 

Surely I would walk some of the items later. 

May I remind you about a bit inconsistency? 

"A Programmer with Microsoft Tools", however, 7-zip is of cross platform open source tools.

I've used in 2012, but I'll throw out a list of things that I couldn't do without:

Visual Studio 2010 SP1
SQL Server Management Studio

Microsoft OneNote 2007
Microsoft Word 2007

(*) Removing these from my arsenal may result in a decrease of capabilities and productivity, 
but it would not prevent me from completing my work.

EDIT: Oh yeah, let's not forget Slacker Radio and my copy of Office Space!

Dan Wygant • So many tools to choose from, so little time. I've gotten used to using more toolkits than tools. I didn't see anyone mention: 
+ GhostDoc http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx 
I love this for documenting my code, although I reckon there are other tools for this

+ RazorSql http://www.razorsql.com/ 
It can be run without install, will connect to any database, provides great database specific CRUD support, better than Toad in the respect that it's not database specific, yet provides similar capabilities

+ Azure https://manage.windowsazure.com/

+ SkyDrive https://skydrive.live.com/

+ MEF, Prism, Caliburn.Micro, and a million toolkits

Peter Shaw • @keith - Oh Noes... run away from the Axis of Evil :-) 

@jeff - Winmerge & DIff, all you'll ever need.. esp if you like the command line like me .... 

@Dan - quick question, for MVVM which do you recomend? 

I tried Caliburn and it was just too much overhead, all I want to do is automatically have my 
Properties be INotify enabled without having to add all the BP Code myself, but I'd still like
 to do my window layout the traditional way. The thing I find with most of these tool kit's is you have to start building DI chains and overriding main windows and goodness knows what else. 

to put it another way, which kit do you recomend that would just simply allow me to change all 
my "ints" to "INotifyInts" or "strings" to "INotifyStrings" you get the idea. 

Iv'e got one in my downloads I'm going to check out when I get 5 mins called "Catel" found it 
on NuGet but I suspect again, it's going to want to change everything when all I want is to just 
easily create notifyable properties.

Patrick Smacchia • Since 2004 I am developing a tool for .NET developers named NDepend. 
This tool offers many unique features for .NET developers that cares for:
* Code Structure,
* Dependencies Management,
* Code Evolution,
* Code Diff,
* Code Quality
* Code Metrics
...
WIth NDepend, one can query all this complex data about a code base, through LINQ queries, 
creates rules, and visualize results, all that 100% integrated in Visual Studio.
http://www.ndepend.com/DefaultRules/webframe.html

Since NDepend hasn't been mentioned so far in this discussion, I take a chance to spread the 
word for .NET developers and .NET architects concerned by mentioned topics.
