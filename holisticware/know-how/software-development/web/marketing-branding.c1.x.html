It’s no longer enough to have a physical presence for a company’s business to grow. The new rules 
of branding your business require you to create and maintain a web presence. This could be by getting 
implementing sleek website, creating a social-media presence, and maintaining an aesthetic and consistent
 brand online.
 
You may ask yourself, “Why Create a Website? Why do I need it when I already have a stable business 
and loyal customers?” Well, having a professional website gets your business exposed to global customers.
 Over the past two decades, the Internet has evolved as a gigantic market. Today, more and more people 
 are using the Web as a first place to shop, for its convenience and time saving characteristics. 
 Customers and general users expect a company to maintain a website. With a well-developed site, your 
 products or services are accessible, to prospective customers around the world, 24/7.
 
You’ll hear people say, “I think they have a website, I’ll check out that first.” This proves websites 
DO have a strong impact on the branding of your business or company.
 
Whether your business is big or small, centered on buying or selling goods or services, you’ll need to 
work under the umbrella called “Your Brand”. So, if you are concerned about branding your business for 
the global audience, nothing is as powerful and effective a tool as a website.
Your brand constitutes a package of promises to consumers, whereas branding is the sum of their 
experiences with a product or company. The process of branding entails a set of steps that make consumers
believe and embrace your brand. Branding is of great significance to any business, involved with making 
a physical as well as virtual presence.
 
Today, websites are one of the popular approaches for branding a business. A website encompasses 
almost all the techniques which effectively give your brand an enormous exposure. You need to make your 
website as outstanding as possible, because besides branding your business, it provides the following 
benefits:
 •    Cheaper and flexible than print advertising
 •    Market expansion
 •    24/7 accessible
 •    Improves credibility
 •    Growth opportunity
 •    Diversifies revenue streams
 •    Offers convenience
 •    Adds value and satisfaction
 •    Standardizes sales performance
 •    Two-way communicative marketing
 
So, why should you have an outstanding website? The answer to this question lies in another question.: 
Why does anybody have a name? The answer is, to have an identity. Well, if a name is an identity, what 
is the need of a surname? Obviously, it represents an individual’s family, society, and culture. Now 
how many guys do you know, with a first name of Bob? Probably, a lot. But, there’s only one Bob Sager, 
whom almost everybody knows.
 
Let’s assume there happens to be another guy named Bob Seger. But, if Bob Seger appears in a concert on 
TV, you can tell the difference. Why? It’s mainly because Bob Seger is a brand of his work, skill, and 
industry.
Similarly, your products or services could be the same as another company’s. You’re your website’s design
and content can also be very similar. If that occurs, there is little chance a user will remember you over
your look-alike. This means your brand has failed to make an impression on the user’s mind, and you may 
lose your customer.
 
Hopefully, this explains why companies need websites for branding of their businesses. If you’re planning 
on creating a web presence for your business, you should consider these things carefully for your brand.
