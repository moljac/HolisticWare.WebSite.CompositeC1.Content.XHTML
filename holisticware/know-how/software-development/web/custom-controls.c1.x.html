can you plz tell me how to use custom control 

I have image button on aspx page on click event on image button I want some image to be 
displayed using custom control on the same page..…Is it possible to do so?




wouldn't make such functionality into a custom/composite/server control. If you need to 
be able to reuse a code snippet then perhaps a jquery plugin or user control is the 
correct answer.
 
Assuming what you want to do is click a button and show a predefined image you could use 
something like one of the following:
 
== HTML / JavaScript / CSS == 

<button onclick="document.getElementById('myImageId').style.display=''">click to show image</button>
 <image id="myImageId" src="your image source" style="display:none" /> 

== HTML / JavaScript / CSS / jquery == 

<button id="myButtonId">click to show image</button> 
<image id="myImageId" src="your image source" style="display:none" /> 
<script type="text/javascript">
	$('#myButtonId').click(function () {
		$('#myImageId').css('display', '');
	}); 
</script> 


I haven't tested either of these. (may not be bug free) You could recycle the img tag for 
different images by leaving the src attribute blank and then adding it using JavaScript.
