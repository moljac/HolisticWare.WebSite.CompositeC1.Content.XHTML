Fixed websites have a set width and resizing the browser or viewing it on different 
devices won’t affect on the way the website looks.

Fluid websites are built using percentages for widths. As a result, columns are relative 
to one another and the browser allowing it to scale up and down fluidly.

Adaptive websites introduce media queries to target specific device sizes, like 
	+ desktop (monitors, can be subdivided on big and small monitors)
	+ mobile devices subdivided (d - diagonal)
		+ tablets d > 7"
		+ smartphones d <= 7

Responsive websites are built on a fluid grid and use media queries to control the 
design and its content as it scales down or up with the browser or device.

				Fixed/Fluid					Media querries
Fixed			fixed						no
Fluid			fluid						no
Adaptive		fixed (mostly) or fluid		yes
Responsive		fluid						yes

Responsive - for devices with great display fragmentation (a lot of form factors,
screen resolutions - Android)

Adaptive Design:
When you are designing a website that is adaptive, you design for specific breakpoints. 
When I mean specific breakpoints, I mean designing for devices such as the iPhone 5, 
and the iPad 4. So, in theory, you will have a design that will be adaptive to the 
specified devices above.

Adaptive may have been good awhile ago - mobile devices variety was not problem.

Responsive Design:
When you are designing a website that is responsive, you design for all breakpoints. 
As opposed to Adaptive, your breakpoints will be all devices. Hence devices from all 
manufacturers and all operating system (iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8, Blackberry), 
regardless of the width and height of the device.

But Responsive is really the only way to go because there are so many new devices 
being released constantly with different resolutions, it would be a waste of time to 
design/develop for them all in an adaptive environment... So Responsive is the way to go.




term "adaptive" is the culprit for confusion here!

Bootstrap (and things like it) are responsive, as even a responsive design has to have a 
breakpoint somewhere. Responsive sites may often have fixed widths on some items 
(a option when using Bootstrap - where content can be centred on wider displays instead 
of stretching infinately).

You could have as much control with responsive as adaptive. Adaptive implies a fixed design 
for different devices / specific resolutions, where has 
responsive implies a design that will cater for more than just one specific set of resolutions 
- but all tablets / mobile devices.

I think adaptive is a confusing term and not sure it's generally helpful.



ADAPTIVE VS. RESPONSIVE, WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?
Posted on 23 February 2012

There seems to be some confusion about these terms and what they mean, so here’s my thoughts 
on the subject and few links to back them up. I’m usually not very keen when it comes to 
debating over what something is called, but this time I wanted to make it clear, as I hear 
this question quite often.

“Responsive design” is a subset of a larger concept which is called “Adaptive design”. When 
talking about responsive we refer to the layout only (Ethan Marcotte, fluid grids, flexible 
images & media queries).

“Adaptive design” on the other hand includes much more than just fluid layout. In practice it 
means the same thing as progressive enhancement, which means in short, that we aim to deliver 
the best possible experience to the widest possible audience. Also: “Adaptive design” shouldn’t 
be mixed with “Adaptive layout” which is a completely different thing.

Finally, “Adaptive layout” means a layout done by combining multiple fixed widths. Right now, 
I feel that Adaptive layout — when done right and when fixed widths are combined with fluid 
widths — is one form of responsive design and not just an alternative to it. Zeldman shared a 
bit similar idea in his blog post from 2011.
