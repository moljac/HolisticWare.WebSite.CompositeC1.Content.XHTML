Meta Tags Explained-Create and Check Your Meta Tags


Meta Tags are used to describe information about the document to search engine
robots, browsers and other automatic programs.

Here we will examine the most important Meta tags and how to create and check
them.

Although they are not difficult to create manually there are tools available for
generating and checking Meta Tags that make it easier for those not familiar
with HTML.

Meta tags are contained between  the <HEAD> </HEAD> tags near the top of the
page and are invisible to the end user. Although there are many meta tags we
really only need to concern ourselves  with the 4 commonly used tags:

    * Title
    * Description
    * Keywords
    * Robots

Title Tag

Although not strictly speaking a meta tag, the title tag is the most powerful
tag for search engine optimisation hence it is considered here. Text you place
in the title tag appears in the top bar of the Web browser and is usually the
first line displayed by search engines.

Because of its importance to search engines the title tag should contain your
keywords and should reflect accurately what the page is about The recommended
length is 5-8 words.

Use:

<TITLE> This is the page Title </TITLE>
Description Tag

The page description should accurately describe your Web page and is usually
displayed by the search engines along with the title. The description should be
less than 200 characters and ideally less than 140 characters.

 It should contain one or two of you keyword/keyword phrases with the most
important one appearing near the beginning.

 Use:

<META NAME = "Description" CONTENT ="content">

Example:

<META NAME = "Description"  CONTENT = "Building a Website for beginners. Free
step by step guide to building a Website" >
Keywords Tag

This tag was previously used by search engines to determine page relevancy it is
no longer used by the major engines. The tag is a list of keywords and phrases.
Each Keyword or keyword phrase is separated by a comma.

Try to limit the length to about 10 words, less is usually better. Don't be
tempted to enter 100's of keywords just because you are allowed. Don't repeat
your keyword more than 3 times as some search engines and indexes will penalise
you for spamming.

Use:

 <META NAME = "Keywords" CONTENT="keyword1, keyword2">

Example:

<META NAME ="Keywords" CONTENT= "building a Website, build a Website" >
Robots Tag

The robots tag is not normally used. It is used to tell search engines how to
index the Web Page and follow and links contained on the page. Web pages will be
indexed by search engines and links will be followed unless explicitly being
told not to.

Normally you will want your page to be indexed by the search engines and hence
you will not need to include this tag. Include the tag only when you want to
stop a Web page being indexed.

Use:

<META NAME="ROBOTS"  CONTENTS=" index or noindex ,follow or nofollow">


Examples:

This tag will stop your web page being indexed or following any links on the
page itself.

<META NAME="ROBOTS"  CONTENTS=" noindex ,nofollow">

This tag will allow your page to be indexed by all search engines:

<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="ALL"> This is equivalent to not including the tag
at all.
 Search Engine Meta Tags Example
<head>
<title> Building a Website-A beginners Guide </title>
<meta name ="keywords" content= "building a Website, build a Website" ></meta>
<meta name = "description"  content = "Building a Website for beginners. Free
step by step guide to building a Website" ></meta>
<meta name="robots" content="ALL"></meta>

</head>
Closing Meta Tags

The new html standard (xhtml) requires a closing meta tag </meta> and so it
should in the future be included and is shown in the example above.

- If you have pages that don't have a closing meta tag then don't worry they
will still work. Just try to use a closing tags in the future.

Meta tag Generator

Although it is very easy to create your own Meta tags most Web page editors have
a built in meta tag generator so that you don't need to enter the HTML yourself.
If yours doesn't then there are several free online meta tag generators that you
can use.

You simply fill out an on line form and the HTML code is created for you. All
you then need to do is to copy and paste the code into your Web page ( while the
editor is displaying HTML).
