	<h1><a id="">HolisticWare - Development (Microsoft .net, Novell Mono)</a></h1>
	<p>
	HolisticWare offers services and expertize in custom software development with accent on the
	cross platform portability. Due to the historical reasons the knowledge is concentrated around
	Microsoft .net, but in order to target other platforms there is plethora of know-how in Mono
	(port of .net to various Unixoides) and its derivatives...
	</p>
	<p>
	In this part one can find our notes, reminders, cheat-sheets about the stuff we have done
	in the past:
	<ul>

	  In late 2007, just as company was started, the team has developed small 
	  introductory web site in ASP.net 2.0, but due to the lack of resources for licensing (read money)
	  the site was hosted on Fedora 11.0 running Mono. Within 2 weeks the site was up and running 
	  featuring CSSFriendly Control Adapters. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Besides that the team has managed to file bug report and fixes to Novell regarding ASP.net
	  generation of CSS class and id attributes for CSS Friendly Control Adapters...
	  And this led that Novell Mono team has subscribed us on several projects where we had honour
	  to have peeks in private previews such as MonoDroid, Mono Tools for Visual Studio etc...
