We have some trouble to run an Asp.Net MVC3 under mono 3.0.2 (profile .NET
4.0)  The webapp runs fine under mono 2.10.9.

In details, we are using  lighttpd 1.4.28 (ssl) webserver. the fastcgi
configuration file is the following:

fastcgi.server = (
    "" => ((
        "socket" => "/tmp/fastcgi-mono-server",
                "bin-path" => "/opt/mono/bin/fastcgi-mono-server4",
                "bin-environment" => (
                        "PATH" => "/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/mono/bin",
                        "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" => "/opt/mono/lib:",
                        "MONO_SHARED_DIR" => "/tmp/",
                        "MONO_FCGI_LOGLEVELS" => "Standard",
                        "MONO_FCGI_LOGFILE" => "/tmp/fastcgi.log",
                        "MONO_FCGI_ROOT" => "/var/www/html/ourwebapp",
                        "MONO_FCGI_APPLICATIONS" => "/:."
                ),
                "max-procs" => 1,
        "check-local" => "disable"
    ))
)

On the server we installed side-by-side either mono Mono 2.10.9 and  Mono
3.0.2> while executing the web application using lighttp with mono 2.10.9
no big issues are found,  when we use mono 3.0.2  and  the latest XSP
(2.10.2) we obtain an empty responses on the client side and the following
error on the server log
