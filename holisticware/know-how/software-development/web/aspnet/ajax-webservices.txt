How are you calling your web service?

If you go to /YourService.asmx/js - does it generate a JavaScript proxy?




I call using jQuery.ajax. I have tried GET and POST, setting accepts:’application/json’, dataType:’json’. 
And all combinations.  The service does not seem to honor  accepts-header, but always returns xml. 
All-in-all, ScriptService/ScriptMethod attributes do not seem to have any effect. 
Service description has methods only when WebMethod attribute is used.

 

Url points to the service as in ‘/MyService.asmx/Hello?name=Bob’. Adding /js to the path produces error.




Can you check if .asmx is mapped to ScriptHandlerFactory in your web.config?

<add path=".asmx" 
	verb="" 
	type="System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptHandlerFactory, System.Web.Extensions, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" 
	validate="False" 
	/>




ono rules, mistakes were mine:

1) I called with $.ajax( { ..., type:"POST", ...} ), but gave the
   method arguments GET-style, as url query string ("?name=bob")
   => arguments have to be given as $.ajax(..., data:"{ name:\"bob\" }"
   Also contentType:"application/json" has to be set,
   whereas dataType:"json" seems to be optional in my setup

2) I did not have a properly configured Web.config file in the
   applications root directory; therefore, the handlers/factories
   required for properly processing ScriptMethod queries were not
   registered.
   => Easiest way of creating a properly configured Web.config is
   to go to application root and to issue "mconfig --target=web af AJAX".
   Easy enough!

3) The minimal attribute set required for ScriptMethods are
   [WebService]  for the service class
   [WebMethod] and [ScriptMethod] for the method.

And thanks Mike and Edgar for your ideas!
