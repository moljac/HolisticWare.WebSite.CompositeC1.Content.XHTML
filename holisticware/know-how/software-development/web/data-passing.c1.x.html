can send data one page to other page through query string or cross page posting 


could use Server.Transfer(...) 

specfied and use server.transfer() instead of response.redirect()...Server.transfer hide values from url.. 


If you are using server.transfer you ext use context object. Otherwise use query string or cross
page posting. 

The simplest method is to use hidden form fields. The data fields are contained in the form just
like any other form field. They are just not visible in the browser.
 
In many situations, this is superior to session variables, because session variables can be corrupted 
if a user has multiple windows open to the same application. Form fields are unique to the displayed 
page, but session variables are only unique to the connection. You can have many tabs or windows sharing 
the same session connection. That's why if you are logged in to a site and then open another window and 
go to the same site, you are already logged in. Your log in state is usually related to the session id. 



If you want to send C# objects from one page to another then you can use the 
DataContractJsonSerializer to serialize the objects to JSON. Then you can send the JSON as a 
querystring parameter. In the other page where you get the JSON querystring parameter, use the 
DataContractJsonSerializer again to deserialize it back into the C# object. 


can simply post data to another page.
