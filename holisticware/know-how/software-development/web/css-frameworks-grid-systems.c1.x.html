think depends on the project to be developed. MVC requires writing more code, but the generated HTML is much more "clean". Moreover, the logic of the project is more flexible, more people than a team can work better in different levels.
 But web forms are easier to understand and does not require thinking about the various levels of design (model, view, control). 
 
 One is not better than the other in a general sense; each has it's strengths and weaknesses, and as Andrea points out it depends on the project. I have worked in groups where the MVC architecture was a great asset. For the types of projects I currently work on (software assistant to the manufacturing process), you cannot beat the speed of web forms development. 


asp.net web forms has lots of server controls but in mvc we have to write pure HTML which takes lots of time.another thin is we have to validate each model and apply security in individual controllers in mvc. 


I agree for a forward facing website, where your concerns might include SEO separation of tasks, TDD, etc. And I know you don't want to deal with passing the ViewState back and forth. Very good for large team development. For a smaller team though (especially one where the developer may have dual responsibilities for both web and win-form development), and for a lot of intranet type scenarios, I think the page controller pattern built into web forms is best, and it is less hassle to manage state information. 



Once you start using ASP.NET MVC you will love it and do not wish any more to go back to web forms. There is a very clear separation of concerns in MVC. Unless if it is an existing web application definitely consider MVC before architecting a new web application. We have developed quite a few MVC Mobile applications for our clients and like the MVC approach. 


To do sophisticated development in ASP.Net requires intimate knowledge with the ordering of individual events, as well as Javascript to handle client side events.
 
I haven't developed in MVC yet, but it makes a lot of sense to me - now that a lot of the communications are in AJAX, building up and tearing down the pages continually using the postback model seems very unwieldy. 


Aps.Net MVC application are given very good performance. But the Asp.Net web forms is good for fast development. But the Asp.Net MVC requires to do on configuration.
 
So if you well in MVC you can use it for any kind of application, it's little like classic Asp but it not. Web forms is good for large business(high scale or big project) projects. 


ASP.NET MVC allows you to have mutch control over HTML and a big separation between presentation logic and data. Requeires more know how to doit of HTML and real knowns about HTTP. Is the ideal when you want to make an aproach to web with ritch html interfaces.
 
Pure ASP.NET still a great technologie and is the natural ,net tech when we are talking about web applications in the LOB or mutch complex web applications.
 
Another point you must consider when choosing is the developer team you have. The learning curve of a good MVC developer is biger then asp.net.
 
My advice would be choose wisely based on the team you have and the tyoe of web application you will build.
