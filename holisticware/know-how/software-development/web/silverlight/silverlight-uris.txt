Silverlight and Uris for multimedia files (images, audio, video)

Question: location of MM files
	silverlight application
		MM file properties:
			content
			copy to output folder = true
	web site
		site origin of Silverlight application - directory where XAP resides
			ClientBin if automatically added by Visual studio
			manually added by developer ??? 
				Silverlight appliation > Add ...????
				
Trying to mimic WPF Uri principles...
			
<MediaElement Source="" />
<Image Source="" />

Rulez:
	include content in SiteOrigin or its subfolders
		set Type to Content
		Copy always.... -> found in XAP
	move XAP to root or whereever
	paths
		leading / root of the Site Origin XAP file
			when not found in XAP fallback to SiteOfOrigin (where XAP resides)
		no leading prefix (combination of / and ..)
			compiled into assembly as resource 
			path is relative to XAML file where file is referenced!!
			cannot be found in XAP because it is in assembly
		absolute uris

		
Multimedia In the code behind or a value converter you can do

  Uri uri = new Uri("http://testsvr.com/hello.jpg");
  YourImage.Source = new BitmapImage(uri);
  
  silverlight app in various circumstances (like if we move the app around in 
the solution, or are dealing with images and other resources located in a 
folder on the web site that's not part of the silverlight project). 


Obtaining the path easily with:

	App.Current.Host.Source

So to get a uri to an image in the Images folder in the web site that hosts the 
silverlight app, use:

var uri = new Uri(App.Current.Host.Source, "../Images/somepic.jpg");


// create a new image
Image image = new Image();

// better to keep this in a global config singleton
string hostName = Application.Current.Host.Source.Host;                   
if (Application.Current.Host.Source.Port != 80)
    hostName += ":" + Application.Current.Host.Source.Port;

// set the image source
Uri uri = new Uri("http://" + hostName + "/cute_kitten112.jpg", UriKind.Absolute);
image.Source = new BitmapImage();

using System.Windows.Resources; 
				// StreamResourceInfo using System.Windows.Media.Imaging; 
				// BitmapImage ....

Uri uri = new Uri("SilverlightApplication1;component/MyImage.png", UriKind.Relative));
StreamResourceInfo sr = Application.GetResourceStream(uri); 
BitmapImage bmp = new BitmapImage(); bmp.SetSource(sr.Stream);
