Google API 

Need Help with Google Analytics API Has anyone coded the Google 
Analytics API within their application? 

I am trying to connect to our GA account via the GA API and not having 
much success. That includes verification of valid connection (username, 
password). Not to mention pulling profile data once connected. 

There are some PhP and other example online that are older and not 
relevant to what I'm trying to do - pull data and metadata (download 
stream). 

Even books are articles would help. Whatever I can get. 

d definitely give these links a go:

Assuming you are using the .net client api and had followed the examples 
provided by Google, have you checked the conversation using Fiddler 2 or 
alike? I would suspect that your enterprise firewall might somehow 
corrupt the conversation at http level. 

Hey Zee, have you isolated a problem? If it's authentication, are you 
set up for the new two-factor authentication? You may not need a 
username/password, but a username/appkey. This has been a stumbling 
block for some other apps using a Google API I've seen. 

Don't know if this is any use:

I saw it yesterday while browsing google developers on Youtube.
