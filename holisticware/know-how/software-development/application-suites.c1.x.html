	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

	<h3><a id="">Complementary App Suites</a></h3>
	<p>
	A group of programs that are packaged to solve common problems in a certain problem
	domain. So if one defines problem domains as graphics, mathemtics, science, I[C]T, so there 
	are suites for graphics, mathematics and other applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	The most popular are "office suites", also known as "productivity suites," defined as a 
	set of basic business programs designed with a  uniform user interface and common 
	functions such as spell checking. The primary programs are word processing, spreadsheet, 
	presentation graphics, database and  e-mail, although each suite has its own mix, and a 
	variety of other programs and utilities may also be included. 
	<br />
	Some of the programs may be for sale as individual products.
