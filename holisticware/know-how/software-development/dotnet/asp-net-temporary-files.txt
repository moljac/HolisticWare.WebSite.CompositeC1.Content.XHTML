I'm using Mono + Apache + Ubuntu for ASP.Net and I can't find the temporary
files folder where compiled aspx pages and code behinds would be. On
Windows, it's stored at
"%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\versionNumber\Temporary ASP.NET Files"
but I can't find anything like that on my Ubuntu file system.

Check /tmp/www-data-temp-aspnet-0/

On Windows, it's stored at 

"%SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\versionNumber\Temporary ASP.NET Files" 
"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\Temporary ASP.NET Files"

but I can't find anything like that on my Ubuntu file system.
