.NET has got a few frameworks you can use. ASP.NET WebForms is an older
framework and it's somewhat similar to JavaServer Pages (JSP) and
JavaServer Faces (JSF). ASP.NET MVC is a newer framework that's somewhat
similar to MVC frameworks like Django or many of the PHP MVC frameworks
(like CodeIgniter, Kohana and FuelPHP). There's also third party frameworks
like ServiceStack <http://www.servicestack.net/mvc-powerpack/> that you can
use instead. I personally prefer ASP.NET MVC but some users prefer WebForms
instead. ASP.NET MVC is very clean and it's pretty easy to get started,
especially if you have experience with other MVC frameworks.

Mono 3.0 supports ASP.NET MVC 3 and MVC 4 "out-of-the-box" so you shouldn't
have much trouble getting it running on Mono. Mono has its own web server
called XSP, but most production environments would use either the Apache
module (mod_mono) or the Mono FastCGI. On Windows, you'd use IIS.
