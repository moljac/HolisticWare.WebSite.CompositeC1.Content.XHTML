It's surprising that mono works at all on linux-ARM. Mono doesn't support the 
hardfp ABI that most modern ARM distros follow which means that it can't even 
start.

And after modern 32-bit ARM ABIs, Mono support for the upcoming 64-bit 
ARM (AArch64) would also be interesting.

It's superfluos to say but if normal soft-float debian "wheezy" (
http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads ) is used,
mono works fine for me.

Using raspian version the application seems to start but there are a lots
of problem with DateTime class , Thread.Sleep and so on.


Thanks
