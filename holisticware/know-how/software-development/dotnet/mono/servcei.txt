With the MONO_OPTIONS environment variable:

MONO_OPTIONS=--gc=sgen mono-service ...

Services under mono are run within the mono-service.exe host, which acts 
as svchost process for your service.

For a nice example how to use it, see this Stackoverflow answer:

 BUT, i cannot deploy any mono service, There isn't any response message 
when i was running that command at blow: 

"mono-service2 --debug -l:<lock file here> <assembly file here>" 

No reason, No response, No errors, The only one result is that my 
service has not start yet!!!!! 

I had tried to use gdb to DEBUG /usr/lib/mono/2.0/mono-service.exe, BUT 
it doesn't works at gdb, because of it said: "cannot execute binary 
file...." 

I had already got some clues that can use "mono 
/usr/lib/mono/2.0/mono-service.exe <assembly file here>" to DEBUG, BUT i 
still cannot get any valuable information to points out that, where is 
the error point.
