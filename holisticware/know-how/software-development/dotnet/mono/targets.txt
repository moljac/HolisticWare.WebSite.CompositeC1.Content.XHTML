Mono Targets


Defined by compiler

targeting .NET 2.0 (using gmcs). 

It seems to work correctly with my project targeting .NET 4.0 (using dmcs). 

I get the correct /debug- flag when I have <DebugType>none</DebugType> in my .csproj file. 
Or maybe you have a mismatched <DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols> in your .csproj?
