debugging embedded 

- I'm now able to generate the mdb file by compiling with MonoDevelop. 
But I had to install Mono 3.0.1 for Windows in order to add a new .NET 
runtimes in MonoDevelop. But I'm currently building my own Mono version 
since I need it to be in x64. Is it the right way to do it our mixing 
the use of these two mono versions is wrong? 

2- I'm now able to attach the MonoDevelop to my mono domain but when a 
breakpoint is triggered, my main app crashed on: - Unhandled exception 
at 0x774d8e3d in engine.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation writing 
location 0x00000000000c0a98 and I got the following message in 
MonoDevelop - System.NullReferenceException has been thrown. have just 
worked on this topic this morning. You will find a nice article about 
this right there :

IIRC, MS.NET compiler generates .pdb files, while Mono's generates .mdb 
files. So using MonoDevelop + MS.NET won't help. Use MonoDevelop in 
Linux, or install Mono for Windows (and configure MonoDevelop to build 
with Mono, not .NET). 

You can also use pdb2mdb which ships with mono:
