Subject: [Mono-list] ConfigurationErrorsException loading user
	settings	(duplicate key)

A few years ago zidjian pointed out an issue on OSX where he was not able to
read 'application' scoped settings from his app.config file.  Attempting to
do so resulted in a ConfigurationErrorsException which explained that there
was a duplicate key for that 'application' scoped setting.

I'm seeing this same issue on Ubuntu and would like to ask the general forum
if there is a known solution for this.  When zidjian asked he posted it in
the OSX forum so there may have been limited visibility.  In the end he
solved the problem by changing the the scope from 'application' to 'user'. 
This solution will not work for me (I'd rather not bore you with a detailed
explanation of why).  Are there any other known solutions or work arounds?

Thanks,





I've resolved the issue.  The source of my problem is that some of my
settings had previously been 'user' scoped.  For this reason the config file
located in ~/.local/share/ set them to a default value.  Like all settings
they were also defined in the config file that sits alongside my executable. 
'application' scoped settings should not be defined in multiple locations so
an error was thrown when a "duplicate key" was found.

In the end I was able to resolve the issue by deleting the config file in
~/.local/share/ and allowing it to be replaced by a file that does not
mention the 'application' scoped settings.
