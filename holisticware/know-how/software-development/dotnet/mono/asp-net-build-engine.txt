MonoDevelop currently build most project types using its internal
build engine, unless you enable the experimental xbuild engine. For
more details, see

This is currently done with MD's internal deployment infrastructure.
Essentially, it copies the project's content and output files to a
directory. It deploys to ssh by mounting the remote directory using
sshfs and copying the files to the mounted directory.

Correct, these transformations are not currently supported.

Unfortunately, adding full support for the MS compile/deploy features
is quite a lot of work. Ideally, we would enable the xbuild engine for
Web projects, and improve complete Mono's implementation of
Microsoft.WebApplication.targets (would need to *cleanly* reverse
engineered the MS version). Mono's Microsoft.WebApplication.targets
does not support many of the publishing/deployment features that the
MS version does - you can see Mono's are very bare-bones
(https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/tools/xbuild/xbuild/Microsoft.WebApplication.targets)
and we don't have an implementation of
Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets at all.

Sure, we really need contributors for MD's & Mono's ASP.NET support.
You could start out by building MD/Mono from source, then try
implementing the features you care about (but make sure you read
http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing#Important_Rules). And feel
free to ask here and on the mono-devel-list if you need pointers
