wcf

Alright, I think Daniel was right. Port 4530 did work, I just had an extra
Listen directive on that port which was blocking my own program from
listening on that port.

Port 943 is not working because I don't know how to run a WCF Service as
root.



I need to use a port under 1024. How can I enable root access to my WCF
service (.dll) ?



Either execute the process as root (not recommended for a public
service), or set a firewall forwarding rule from your port <= 1024
to a port > 1024 where your service is listening at.

You may want to ask an admin about how to achieve this with you
Linux distro, because it's not Mono's job.



started exploring the possibilities of MONO WCF again. All's well
when you test in the browser, fast responses in the required style. However:
Google Chrome's OPTIONS httpmethod, is nowhere to be seen, and Sencha Touch
wont continue without an response to it.

I have a IDispatchMessageInspector, that handels the
("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); header to be added, that works for GET
methods.

Does anyone know why OPTIONS method requests don't come through ?
