Well, not quite.  Like with .Net, you have the runtime version and the language
versions.

Eg, it is possible to write using C# 4.0 and target the .Net 3.5 runtime (
which will run on mono 2.10.x and .Net )

In which case your compiler will need to understand C# 4.0 ( which dmcs does )

Your application (once compiled) will be able to run on a particular runtime
profile, eg, .Net 2.0, .Net 3.5, .Net 4.0 etc
