Mono* on Debian
	http://inorton.wordpress.com/
	
For a while now, it’s not been easy to install the bleeding
edge mono and monodevelop, while the stock ubuntu packages are 
good and the debian experimental ones are very good, they are 
still both quite old (due to having the requirement that they 
exist to support a whole chunk of an entire linux installation ) 
and so do not get fixes very quickly. With this in mind I have 
decided to create (and try to maintain) packages for a full 
parallel mono environment of the latest stable/released mono 
and monodevelop.
 


These packages will not interfere or interact with your existing 
binary (deb) installation of mono or monodevelop so it won’t 
break your package manager nor your existing mono based apps 
and libraries.
 
Release 5 of the “pmono” ubuntu packages for mono and monodevelop 
are now complete and uploaded.
 
Installation:
 
Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list
 deb http://void.printf.net/~bredroll/pmono ./ 
Then run:
 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pmono-* 
Usage:
 $ pmono bash 
$ pmono mono ... 
$ pmono gsharp ... 
$ pmono monodevelop 
etc..	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	


1. Configure Default route

/etc/sysconfig/network

	NETWORKING=yes
	HOSTNAME=localhost
	GATEWAY=192.168.1.251	# DEFAULT ROUTE

2. Configure static routes

/etc/sysconfig/static-routes

#specific interface (eth[0,1,…])

	eth0 host 10.0.0.1 		gw 192.168.1.1	# Only 1 host
	eth0 net  10.10.0.0/16 	gw 192.168.1.1	# Route whole 10.10.x.x network


#any interface (any)

	any host 10.0.0.1 		gw 192.168.1.1	# Only 1 host
	any net  10.10.0.0/16 	gw 192.168.1.1	# Route whole 10.10.x.x network

3. Restart network and check routing table

	# /etc/init.d/network restart
	Shutting down interface eth0:                                           [  OK  ]
	Shutting down loopback interface:                                       [  OK  ]
	Setting network parameters:                                             [  OK  ]
	Bringing up loopback interface:                                         [  OK  ]
	Bringing up interface eth0:                                             [  OK  ]

	# route -n or netstat -rn
	Kernel IP routing table
