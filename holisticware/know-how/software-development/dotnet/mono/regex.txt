regex


So, I recently did a major update to my ASP.Net website running on
Mono (runs on .Net as well, but I work on it and host it with Mono).
Long story short, my websites performance sunk big time. It now takes
110ms for a response that once took less than 20ms.

I traced down the big difference to using regular expressions as a
part of my routing and a few other things. (I have a custom MVC
framework: https://bitbucket.org/earlz/barelymvc).

Here are some(maybe all) of the regular expressions being used
(they're really simple):

@"[^a-zA-Z0-9]\ "
@"[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]"
"^[0-9a-zA-Z]+$"
@"^[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+$"
 "^[-+]?[0-9]*$"
"^[0-9A-Fa-f]+$"

All of these regular expressions are compiled once at application
startup and cached. (with RegexOptions.Compiled). They are used with
with IsMatch(input) or Replace(input, replacement);

When profiling my application however, the number one most time
consuming method was `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Interpreter:Eval
(System.Text.RegularExpressions.Interpreter/Mode,int&,int)` (my
database functions, which are also not really fast didn't even compare
to the amount of time this function consumed)

Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem? I'm using the
latest stable version of Mono (Arch Linux) on a 64-bit platform. Is it
true also that regular expression should now be on par with .Net's
implementation? From what I understand, mono compiles them to IL
correct? Is there anything to watch for in regular expressions that
could give me performance problems like this?




Are you sure your site is running in release mode (debug="false" in your
web.config, and Release build config for assemblies)? Running in debug mode
will turn off lots of optimisations that may cause slowdown.

It might be worth trying out
Regex.CompileToAssembly<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9ek5zak6.aspx>to
precompile your regular expressions - This will create a separate .NET
assembly which has pre-optimised versions of the regular expressions.
However I've found this is only beneficial for very large regular
expressions, and regular expressions that are used a lot. So it might not
help too much (but it doesn't hurt to try it to see if it makes a
difference or not). As far as I know, Mono doesn't
support Regex.CompileToAssembly, but you should be able to generate the
assembly on Microsoft .NET, and then use the generated assembly with Mono.
I haven't tried this myself though.

Out of curiosity, how are you profiling the code?




I actually found out how to use the profiler a bit better and found
that MarkdownSharp(http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) is what
makes extensive use of regular expressions, however, the majority of
it's regular expressions are also compiled. (though are of course
significantly more complex).

Now, on to your questions

Yes, it's in release mode with debug=false

That's an option, but I'd really prefer to avoid it. My regular
expressions are easily cacheable and used quite a bit, but not complex
at all.

I'm using this:

mono --profile=log:noalloc,calls,maxframes=16 /usr/lib/mono/4.0/xsp4.exe

I know xsp isn't a production server or anything, but I don't think it
matters much in this case. (I see the same kind of speed problems with
mod_mono and apache).

I then read the report like this:

mprof-report --method-sort=total --traces output.mlpd  > report.txt

And I generate the load on my test application using apache's ab


Also, I'm wondering if it's suppose to call
`System.Text.RegularExpressions.Interpreter:Eval
(System.Text.RegularExpressions.Interpreter/Mode,int&,int)` when
working with compiled regexs. My gut tells me it's not support to do
that, but I don't know the mono internals at all.
