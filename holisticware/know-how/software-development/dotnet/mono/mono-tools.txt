Welcome.  What you're looking for is the mono-tools plugin for visual studio 
on windows.  Install visual studio, and this plugin, and mono for windows.  
This will allow you to write code, debug as usual in .Net, and then click 
a special Mono menu inside Visual Studio, and Run or Debug in mono on windows.

Also look for monotools-server.  You run this on linux/mac/whatever, and you
 connect to it remotely via the same Mono menu in visual studio.  Remotely run 
 or debug in mono on a remote non-windows system, while you are sitting 
 comfortably inside visual studio debugger the whole time.
