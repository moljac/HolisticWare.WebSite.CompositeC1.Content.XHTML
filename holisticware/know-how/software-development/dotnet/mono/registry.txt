Registry


Can we run .Net applications that modifies windows registry by using mono
from SUSE Linux ?

Mono has a partial registry implementation that only affects Mono
instances, no system-wide visibility, so most changes in settings
meaningful in Windows will have no effect whatsoever in the SUSE Linux
system.


What are you trying to achieve? Because simply put; SUSE Linux doesn't
have the window registry, so you can' t manipulate it.


was trying to use 1 windows service using mono on linux. When service
runs on windows platform it stores its configuration values in 1 registry
key. I thought ,is it possible that mono will replace all Registry related
methods to equivalent of registry in linux. I know there is Registry as
such  in linux,but somewhere linux will be storing its s/w related
configurations.




*What about writing to the registry? As I understand it, Linux does not
have a counterpart to the registry. Should I avoid relying on that feature?*

Try to avoid it. Although there would be a emulation for registry in Mono
too. GNOME does have a registry like mechanism for configuration. But Even
if gnome has a configuration system similar to the registry, the keys will
not be equal, so you will probably end up having to do some runtime
detection, and depending on this load an assembly that has your
platform-specific hacks.
