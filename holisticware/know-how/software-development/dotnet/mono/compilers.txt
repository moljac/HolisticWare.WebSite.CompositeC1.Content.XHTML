I just installed 3.0.5 and I can't get gmcs to run. What's more, I can't
even
find the gmcs executable. Mono is found no problem.

I've tried adding the bin dir to the path myself, I've tried the command
prompt from the Start menu, and I've tried installing to a dir with no
spaces--just to be sure.

Here is the error:
'gmcs' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
program or batch file.

What's the executable? .bat? .exe? And where is it supposed to install?

Thanks in advance for your help.



Have you tried "mcs -sdk:2"? Mono 2.11 merged all the compilers into the
one unified compiler, and now gmcs is a shell script that simply calls mcs
(at least on Linux).
