Bundling


ith regards to embedding the Mono runtime into an executable, I have seen
the following commands on the web:

mkbundle --deps --config-dir "./lib" MyApp.exe

cc -arch i386 -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -I /opt/local/include/glib-2.0 -I
/opt/local/lib/glib-2.0/include -g -o MyApp -Wall temp.c `pkg-config
--cflags --libs mono` temp.o

I understand what the first command is doing, but what is the purpose of the
second command?  It appears to me that it is using the clang compiler to
link the mono runtime with MyApp.exe, but isn't that redundant as mkbundle
does this as well?



The second command is compiling a stub "C" program that embeds the
assemblies and which is linked against Mono's runtime library.
Its output is the actual executable that you can invoke like a
native program.
