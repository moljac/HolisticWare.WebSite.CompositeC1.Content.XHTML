mono tracing

How are you doing the HTTP requests? Through WebRequest, WebClient or
HttpClient?

The error is coming from System.Web.TraceManager which I believe
handles application-level
ASP.NET tracing<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1y89ed7z(v=vs.85).aspx>
(so
I'm not sure why it's being invoked with a console application). Do you
have anything odd in your App.config file?
