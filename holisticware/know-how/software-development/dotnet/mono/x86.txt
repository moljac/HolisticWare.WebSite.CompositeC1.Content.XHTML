x86


to inspect the x86 assembly that mono generates from my .exe. Mostly for specific functions. How do I achieve this?

$ mono --help-devel

tells me that I could compile a method and generate assembly for it. How should I be using it? If I do:
$ mono --ncompile 1 --compile METHODNAME EXENAME EXEOPTIONS

I get an error saying:
Usage: mini --ncompile num --compile method assembly

How do you guys inspect the generated assembly while developing? Is there some other internal option that enables that?










can use Ahead of Time compilation to generate a .so file with native
code. Is this what you're looking for?

orgot to cc previous mail to the list and maybe someone will find it
useful too. mono -v -v can be used to obtain assembly.

Btw, AOT output can not necessarily be the same.
