"configure --with-tls=pthread CC=clang CXX=clang++" passes

"make" passes

"make check" most tests pass - one failure

"make run-test" most tests pass for mscorlib - 67 not run and then I
ran into a dependency problem (known and local to my test setup) and
decided it is not worth investigating further. I am sure it is
nothing.
