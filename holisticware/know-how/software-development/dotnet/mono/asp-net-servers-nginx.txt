All traffic to that URL [www.daniel-steiger.ch] (except for the
folders /doc and /images), but including images in /Content, is directly
forwarded to fastcgi by nginx, as per fastcgi config file for domain.


 server {
          listen   80;
          server_name www.daniel-steiger.ch daniel-steiger.ch;
          access_log   /var/log/nginx/daniel-steiger.ch.access.log;

         location / {
                  root /home/danillo/www/HomePage;
                  #index index.html index.htm default.aspx
Default.aspx;
                  #fastcgi_index Default.aspx;
                  fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
                  include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
          }

# redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html

 error_page 500 501 503 504 /50x.html;
 location = /50x.html {

It's sufficient to have the file served without FileResult.
Of course it's more efficient if nginx serves it directly, but this is
a very low traffic website, so performance is really not my problem 

And by the way, the problem is not finding a workaround.
 I have already fixed it with a workaround about a week ago.
 I really just want to know where the bug is, because if FileResult
malfunctions, there's probably more to it, and I don't want to walk into a
subtle not at the first sight spottable bug later, like a botched binary
upload/download file.

Hmm... Maybe try an X-Accel-Redirect header instead. This lets Nginx
serve the file instead of Mono having to serve it, which makes it more
efficient. See if that makes a difference, or if it has the same issue.

Why not just link directly to the file, instead of serving it through
your C# code?







I'd still suggest letting Nginx serve your static files. Just because
the site is low-traffic doesn't mean that little performance tweaks aren't
good . I do something like this:
 location / {
 # Pass requests for unknown files to Mono
 try_files $uri @mono;
}

 location @mono {
 # Put all your Mono config here
}
