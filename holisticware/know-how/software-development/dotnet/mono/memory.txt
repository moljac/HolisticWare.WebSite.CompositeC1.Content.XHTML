  I've recently upgraded our web server from Mono 2.10.8 to Mono 3.2.0 
(built from source tarball), but I'm noticing a huge difference in 
memory usage. The old version would startup our ASP.NET MVC 2 website 
using ~100MB and over approximately two weeks grow to use around 
500-600MB. However, the latest version starts up using ~100MB but has 
grown to use over 1GB+ in just two days under exactly the same load. I 
might try switching to using the Boehm garbage collector to see if that 
is any better. 

Any advice on how to go about diagnosing where this leak is occurring 
would be greatly appreciated! 

Our stack is as follows; Amazon Linux x86-64, Apache 2.2, Mono 3.2.0, 
mod_mono 2.10 



 recently found out that mono has  a pretty obscure GC memory cap option
that one can set as an environmental variable, e.g.

setenv MONO_GC_PARAMS max-heap-size=8G

Which seems analogous to the java -Xmx parameter.  You could try setting
that, if most of the memory is in use simply because a GC hasn't occurred
and mono doesn't know it should use so much memory, that might help.  It's
been keeping the memory of my programs down quite a bit.
