for DynamicObject and the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) were added in Mono
2.6 or 2.8. I've used dynamic in Mono 2.10 and 3.0 and it seems to work.

DynamicObject is in the System.Dynamic namespace which is in
System.Core.dll, which is a core part of the .NET Framework.




ystem.Core is an assembly (System.Core.dll), not a namespace. There is no "System.Core" namespace. System.Core.dll contains types in the namespaces System.IO, System.Linq, System.Threading, and others:

	https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/mcs/class/System.Core

`using System.Core;` is thus not valid in a C# app, unless you yourself have declared types in a "System.Core" namespace.



$ csharp -r:System.Core 
> using System.Linq;
> var x = new int[] { 1,2,3,4,5,6 };
> var y = (from i in x where i > 4 select x).Skip(1).FirstOrDefault();



That shouldn't be necessary at all; System.Core.dll should be in the default assembly include set and `using System.Linq` should be in the default namespace set for `csharp` so that you can immediately use LINQ:

	$ csharp
	Mono C# Shell, type "help;" for help

	Enter statements below.
	csharp> Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Max();
	10
