Your Web.config has references to Entity Framework 4, which Mono doesn't
support.  You'll have to remove all the EntityFramework sections from the
Web.config (the <section> node at the top, and the <entityFramework> node
at the bottom). Delete EntityFramework.dll from your application's bin
folder if it exists in there. If you want to use Entity Framework, you will
have to use version 6, as this is the only version that Microsoft has
released as open source. It hasn't had an official release yet, but you can
grab EntityFramework.dll from your Mono installation.

Also ensure you delete Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll as Mono has its own
implementation of this assembly (Microsoft's implementation is dependent on
IIS).

I'm not sure how you configure it with Apache (I use nginx myself), but you
need to route all requests for non-existent files to Mono. Just routing
them based on extensions (AddHandler mono .aspx ascx .asax .ashx .config
.cs .vb .asmx .axd) won't work, as ASP.NET MVC doesn't use file extensions.
