httpwebrequest-webexception-certificate


The Error:

System.Net.WebException() Error getting response stream (Write: The
authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure
   at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.EndGetRequestStream (IAsyncResult
asyncResult) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 
  at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetRequestStream () [0x00000] in <filename
unknown>:0 

This works when run using .net, but fails at  request.GetRequestStream() as
shown both on a Windows7 box running mono 2.10.8 and on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04)
on both an x86 box and on ARM (Beagle).

Googling suggests that a certificate issue might cause it to fail at
WebRequest.Create(URL), but that does not seem to be the same problem.

I also tried using CredentialCache, but I understand that using "Digest"
with CredentialCache forces MD5, and the server API I am accessing uses SHA
256, not MD5. (the hashed password and userID are embedded in the
JsonRequest)



Solution:


apparently it was the same certificates issue, just a different error
message. Solution was:

Add:

using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Net.Security;
( other than X509 these may have already been present - didn't check)

In the class constructor:

ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = new
RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(DummyCertValidationCb); 

and the call back itself:

public static bool DummyCertValidationCb(object sender, X509Certificate
certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
        {
	   // we could actually test for a valid certificate here but in this case
we don't care....
            return true;
        }
