just built and installed latest Mono (3.0.7) and XSP on OpenSuse and
while the fastcgi server works, trying to run XSP4, fails with the error
shown below.  Running under Windows with XSP4 works fine with both .NET and
Mono runtimes.

I'm not sure if this is related but I'm running Mono 3 in parallel to Mono
2.10.2, build and installed with --prefix=/opt/mono3. I'm setting the
following environment variables before launching XSP:

MONO_PREFIX=/opt/mono3
export
DYLD_LIBRARY_FALLBACK_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_FALLBACK_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/bin:$PATH

Launching XSP with the following from the webapp directory:

sudo xsp4 --port 80

And getting the following error:

System.Web.Compilation.CompilationException
CS8026: Invalid sdk version name

Description: Error compiling a resource required to service this request.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Check the xsp4 shell script and ensure it's using the correct Mono version. 
It might be using /usr/bin/mono instead of /opt/mono3/bin/mono.








Is this correct?  

    #!/bin/sh
    exec /opt/mono3/bin/mono $MONO_OPTIONS
"/opt/mono3/lib/mono/4.5/xsp4.exe" "$@"

It looks ok to me, although I thought perhaps "4.5" should be "4.0", but
there's no xsp4.exe in that folder.

Also, the xsp4.exe in the 4.5 folder is a link to the gac as follows:

    xsp4.exe -> ../gac/xsp4/2.11.0.0__0738eb9f132ed756/xsp4.exe

No idea if this is correct or not.

Based on that symlink, it looks like you're using XSP 2.11.0 with Mono 3. 
I believe you need to use the latest version of XSP, which you can get 
from Github: https://github.com/mono/xsp



Thanks for your help on this Daniel,

I'm pretty sure that's what I've got and it was built with the environment setup for the mono 3.0.
