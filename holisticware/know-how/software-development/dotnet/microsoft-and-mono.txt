Microsoft and Mono


Microsoft has helped Mono by open sourcing very large chunks of .NET code
that run on Mono.

Things like the F#, IronPython and IronRuby languages.   The Dynamic
Language Runtime, ASP.NET MVC up to version 4, their new WebAPI, the OData
Client, EntityFramework, WebMatrix.Data and a few more that I might have
missed.
