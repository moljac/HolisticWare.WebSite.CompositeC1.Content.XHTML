erviceStack ORMLite for my site, but most of the "micro" ORMs (Dapper, ORMLite, 
Simple.Data, PetaPoco, etc.) work on Mono. These are good for simple mapping 
and relatively simple queries.

NHibernate should also work on Mono, although I've never tried it. I'd suggest 
trying out NHibernate if you need more advanced features. You can use Fluent 
NHibernate to get a nice fluent syntax for mapping your classes 
(by default, NHibernate uses XML mapping files).
