I am looking for a decent JSON option for Monotouch for both serializing and 
deserializing. My preference for all of my Windows development has been Json.Net 
but it doesn't seem to be properly supported for Monotouch. I got the latest source 
code and tried to compile it's portable library and then tried by setting the 
Silverlight and PocketPC compiler options but it still has quite a few compiler errors.

Do you just use the built in System.Json? I haven't used it much so I don't 
have an opinion on it.
