It is not possible to use WCF proxies that is built with .NET 4.0 profile. 
WCF in Mono for Android is based on almost the same API profile as what Silverlight 
had, which references "2.1" profile of WCF assemblies. 

To generate 2.1-compatible WCF proxies, one needs to use:
	Silverlight SDK's SlSvcUtil.exe 
	or 
	mono's svcutil with --moonlight or --monotouch option.
