Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE) is a cross-platform OO network 
programming toolkit written in C++. Wikipedia has a good description.



The STL (Standard Template Library) should be provided by all decent C++ 
compilers. If you don't know it, you should. If you think you don't need 
it, it's fine if you have good reasons, but you have to know it first anyway.

Boost ( http://www.boost.org ) is a big set of libraries that is complementary
to the STL. Most of the STL additions are first provided in Boost before 
getting to the official standard library status. Most of the time, you find 
in Boost what you need when it's related to general algorithms/structures. 
The main exception is GUI lib.

A tiny alternative to Boost is POCO ( http://pocoproject.org/ ). It provides 
some of the most essential libraries that are already in Boost, but implemented 
in another way, easier to read an learn if you're not yet a C++ specialist. 
It's not as "complete" (or "with as much variety" should I say) than Boost, 
but it's sometime interesting. Learn a bit about it to know your choices.

For GUI, as other suggested, in C++, QT might be the more useful GUI 
(and other tools) library at the moment. Alternatives are wxWidgets and 
GTK (gtkmm) for the more known.
