Xwt is not a replacement for Gtk#. It is merely a wrapper around Gtk#. It
will never replace Gtk# as it is a lowest-common-denominator API which
covers Wpf, Gtk and MonoMac.

MonoDevelop is still based purely on Gtk# 2.x and Gtk+ 2.x.

Generating bindings for Gtk# 3 is an opensource effort and most of the work
has been done. There are a few summer of code proposals to work on it, so
if one of them is accepted it's possible it'll be finished in the next few
months. However anyone is free to contribute too!
