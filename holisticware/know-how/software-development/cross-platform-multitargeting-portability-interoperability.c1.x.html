	<h1><a id="">Multitargeting - Portability - Interoperability</a></h1>
	<p>
	In human nature there is a drive to automate repetitive tasks in order to be more
	productive, to spend less time on those tasks, thus gaining more extra time.
	If this extra gained time is used for further activities/tasks like investment in 
	knowledge (learning, education), cultural hoist/raise, physical activities etc, 
	then one cannot talk that humans are inherently lazy.
	But on the other hand of this extra spare time is not used for further activities
	then the labeling "lazy" might be appropriate.
	<br />
	In our team's mindset we encourage team-members to be lazy, to code less through
	code reuse, to write scripts for long everyday repetitive tasks and to use this
	time gained for themselves to learn, train, improve themselves in any aspect.
	<br />
	As the matter of fact this kind of "laziness" is considered as added value.
	</p>
	<p>
	Lazy-bum (admin or/and developer) howto:
	
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Script! Write a script!
		<br />
		After doing something write a script, there's high possibility that it will be 
		needed again (and again).
		</li>
		<li>
		Reuse! Reuse code written!
		<br />
		When writing code, extract what is useful, parameterize it (generalize) and put
		into library.
		Add unit testing to be sure it works after changes (requirements fulfillment, 
		acceptance and regression tests, etc...)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	So share code, no matter source or scripts...
	</p>


	<h2><a id="">History - brief</a></h2>
	<p>
	It is interesting that in Microsoft development community code sharing thoughts
	intensified with dawn of Silverlight, when it was realized that code between WPF and
	Silverlight could be shared... Although it was true for other earlier application
	types (WinForms etc).
	</p>
	<p>
	With the work of Monoists implementing MonoTouch, Mono For Android etc, code sharing
	is more than necessity.
	</p>
	<p>
	Today it is possible to write shared Model (Business Logic) and N Views (Presentation
	Layers) for N platforms (some can be shared, but generally not)....
	</p>
	



	<h2><a id="">HowTo</a></h2>
	<p>
	Core concept of the code reuse can be nicely shown on the concept of 
	<a href="~/HolisticWare/Know-How/Development/Appliaction-Suites.aspx">
	Multiplatform - Application Suites
	</a> 
	where 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>determine smallest subset
			<p>
			WP7 or so... make it source project all will be linked to it ...
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>determine Naming to preserve project order in VisualStudio solutions
			<p>
			HolisticWare team inserts numbering to achieve this see sample!!
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>heavy use of partial classes
			<ul>
				<li>ClassName.cs (shared-linked accross linked Projects)
					<p>
						make an empty Class just to shut up compiler if code is only platform specific!</p>
				</li>
				<li>ClassName.&lt;Platform&gt;.cs in project as project/platform specific code
					<p>
						Platform=Silverlight in Silverlight/WP7
					</p>
					<p>
					add ClassName.MonoDroid.cs in Monodroid project
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>UI
			<ul>
				<li>Make UI on Desktop/RichClient/Web as a mosaic of controls from mobile projects
					<p>
					WP7 pages are 480x800 (make them controls and reuse XAML in RIA and WPF)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Adding new Platforms (read Projects)
			<ul>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
