esizing images with the same c# code on windows and linux and the results on 
linux are worse. Just a bit less than acceptable.
What should I do to get comparable good results?

What I'm doing right now:

 image.RotateFlip(System.Drawing.RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipNone);
 image.RotateFlip(System.Drawing.RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipNone);

var resized  =  resizedImage = image.GetThumbnailImage(width, height, null, IntPtr.Zero);

 var encoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(1);
 encoderParameters.Param[0] = new EncoderParameter(System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder.Quality, 90);

saving...

Or is this the way to go?

Microsoft's .NET Framework uses GDI+ (which is a part of Windows) whereas Mono uses libgdiplus 
which is a wrapper around the Cairo graphics library. This is why you're seeing differences 
between the two.

The link you posted uses the ImageMagick library, which is something I'd recommend if you're 
not happy with the quality of the System.Drawing output. ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick, which 
is a fork of it) is what I use with PHP and Node.js and it works pretty well. If you don't want 
to mess around with P/Invoke and native libraries, you could just use System.Diagnostics.Process 
to run ImageMagick. Just get it working perfectly from the command-line, and then copy the 
command into your app :).

See the ImageMagick docs: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/#resize

Thank you both for your fast answers! I'm using now the technique described in your blog article
and it works fine. :) My ImageMagick downsized jpeg images are still a tiny bit less sharp than 
GDI+ but filesize is also smaller like 30-40%. I'm happy with that for now! Image resizing seems 
to be a big topic anyways if I look at that ImageMagick documentation about that.



You could try GraphicsMagick - It's a fork of ImageMagick that has had some tweaks done. Not 
sure if any of the tweaks relate to quality. I think there's a whole bunch of options you can 
use that might help, too.

Glad to hear you got it working, though!
