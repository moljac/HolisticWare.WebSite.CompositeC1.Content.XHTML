 it is possible to get an activation code by emailing
support@xamarin.com and/or betai@xamarin.com and asking for it. I am going
to try that.

I'm still curious about the future plans for Mono Tools though, I hope the
project/product isn't being killed.

That worked for me - I got an activation code.  I also sent them follow-up
email about the registration form not working and such.  Maybe they can't
or won't do anything about it, but at least they've been notified...  So we
can hope for the best...



As for the future plans of Mono Tools, Xamarin owns the product but
quit selling it in July 2011. We currently use the Visual Studio add-in
as the basis for our Mono for Android Visual Studio Add-in, and plan
to offer similar platform-specific add-ins for targeting iOS and OS X.
We do not currently offer any products for targeting Linux (servers or
embedded devices); however, we have been making the tools freely
available for developers that found them useful.

2012-11

We're not offering Mono Tools for Visual Studio for sale at this time,
while we reconfigure the offerings to try to make the tools more useful for
the kinds of scenarios we're capable of supporting. (For instance, we'll
likely introduce better support for Mac development in an upcoming
release). Upcoming product offerings will be made available via
Xamarin.com, and the mono-tools.com will be deprecated in favor of that.
