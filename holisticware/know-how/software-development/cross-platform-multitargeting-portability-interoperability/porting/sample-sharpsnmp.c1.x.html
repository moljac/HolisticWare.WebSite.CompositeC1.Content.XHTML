when you are using Strong Named Keys (snk) files but you only have the .SNK file 
assigned to one of the two projects you are trying to compile. 
If you are using InternalsVisibleTo to expose Friend/Internal methods to another 
DLL, and either one of the DLLs has a strong named key, make sure they both have a 
strong named key. You can use the same strong name key on both DLLs.

Split projects and their projct files
	SharpSnmpLib
	SharpSnmpLib.Controls
	SharpSnmpLib.Mib
	SharpSnmpLib.Optional
originally foung in SharpSnmpLib\ folder into appropriate folders:
	SharpSnmpLib
	SharpSnmpLibControls
	SharpSnmpLibMib
	SharpSnmpLibOptional

This was done according to Holisticware team rules and recommendations (R&Rs) 
forVisual Studio projects.

Generates folder with project file in it (project files do not share folders) It can be done, but
decreases readability and maintaiability.

Projects renamed accordingly to folders (again R&Rs):
	SharpSnmpLib
	SharpSnmpLibControls
	SharpSnmpLibMib
	SharpSnmpLibOptional

Silence errors in WP projects
	Serializable Attribute
		quick and dirty: either unload WP project
		nicer: 
			for classes (they do support partial keyword):
			split into partial classes in 2 files (one with Serializable attribute and empty class)
			moved projects which support Serializable 
			workflow: move (cut + paste) to Desktop and link-copy to MT and MA (or vice versa)
			VS Project Lniker workflow: exclude from project, cut, paste, include in project)
			
			for enums (they do not support partial keyword):
			copied to projects which support Serializable
			workflow: copy to Desktop and link-copy to MT and MA projects (or vice
			VS Project Lniker workflow: exclude from project, cut, paste, include in project
