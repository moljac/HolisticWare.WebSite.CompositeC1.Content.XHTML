Could you please obtain a trace of the hung process? To do this, when Xamarin Studio 
hangs, open a terminal, and run the command killall -QUIT XamarinStudio. This will not 
terminate Xamarin Studio, but will cause it to write stacktraces of all its threads 
to its log file.

Then, please file a bug and attach the log file (from ~/Library/Logs/XamarinStudio-4.0) 
and full version details from the About dialog.
