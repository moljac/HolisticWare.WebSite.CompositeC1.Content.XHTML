XS4 v.4.0.1. build 9 iOS library - no iOS specific build configurations

Hi we are extracting our cross-platform shared code to something like
Xamarin.API and just created solution (empty) on MacOSX addded MT library, but
there are no build configs specific to iOS (Ad-Hoc and AppStore, iPhone and iPhoneSimulator).
 
Xamarin.iOS plugin for VS adds configs to library.

Configs must be added manually in Seolution /+ Options +/ Cnofigurations after MT/iOS
application project is added to solution or to solution referenceing this solution...

Actions

1. Add iOS/MT library to existing [blank] solution
2. choose other projects
3. pick solution sln file

setup

* 	MacOSX Mountain Lion
* 	XS 4.0.1 build 9


Setup:

* 	XS4 v.4.0.1. build 9 
* 	MacOSX Moun
