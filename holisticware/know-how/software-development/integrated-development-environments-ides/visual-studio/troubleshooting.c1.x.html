Invalid Command Line. Unknown Switch : help.

Use:
devenv  [solutionfile | projectfile | anyfile.ext]  [switches]

The first argument for devenv is usually a solution file or project file.
You can also use any other file as the first argument if you want to have the
file open automatically in an editor. When you enter a project file, the IDE
looks for an .sln file with the same base name as the project file in the
parent directory for the project file. If no such .sln file exists, then the
IDE looks for a single .sln file that references the project. If no such single
.sln file exists, then the IDE creates an unsaved solution with a default .sln
file name that has the same base name as the project file.

Command line builds:
devenv solutionfile.sln /build [ solutionconfig ] [ /project projectnameorfile [ /projectconfig name ] ]
Available command line switches:

/Build          Builds the solution or project with the specified solution
				configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms
				are possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
				and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
/Clean          Deletes build outputs.
/Command        Starts the IDE and executes the command.
/Deploy         Builds and then deploys the specified build configuration.
/Edit           Opens the specified files in a running instance of this
				application. If there are no running instances, it will
				start a new instance with a simplified window layout.
/LCID           Sets the default language in the IDE for the UI.
/Log            Logs IDE activity to the specified file for troubleshooting.
/NoVSIP         Disables the VSIP developer's license key for VSIP testing.
/Out            Appends the build log to a specified file.
/Project        Specifies the project to build, clean, or deploy.
				Must be used with /Build, /Rebuild, /Clean, or /Deploy.
/ProjectConfig  Overrides the project configuration specified in the solution
				configuration. For example "Debug". If multiple platforms are
				possible, the configuration name must be enclosed in quotes
				and contain platform name. For example: "Debug|Win32".
				Must be used with /Project.
/Rebuild        Cleans and then builds the solution or project with the
				specified configuration.
/ResetAddin     Removes commands and command UI associated with the specified Add-in.
/ResetSettings  Restores the IDE's default settings, optionally resets to
				the specified VSSettings file.
/ResetSkipPkgs  Clears all SkipLoading tags added to VSPackages.
/Run            Compiles and runs the specified solution.
/RunExit        Compiles and runs the specified solution then closes the IDE.
/SafeMode       Launches the IDE in safe mode loading minimal windows.
/Upgrade        Upgrades the project or the solution and all projects in it.
				A backup of these files will be created as appropriate.  Please
				see Help on 'Visual Studio Conversion Wizard' for more
				information on the backup process.

Product-specific switches:

/debugexe       Open the specified executable to be debugged. The
		remainder of the command line is passed to this
				executable as its arguments.
/useenv         Use PATH, INCLUDE, LIBPATH, and LIB environment variables
				instead of IDE paths for VC++ builds.

To attach the debugger from the command line, use:
		VsJITDebugger.exe -p <pid>
