xml file. For that reason I created a
subfolder into the resources one, and it`s name is xml.
After that, in my projecto, I use the xmldocument method in this way:
xmlDocument xDoc = new xmlDocument();
xDoc.Load("Data.xml");

But it crashes, and i Have tested a lot of ways to pass the url of my xml
doc, but it allways crashes.
Can anybody help me and tell me how I can Load a a xml file from the
Resources/Xml folder.

ou then (presumably) added a Data.xml file to the Resources\Xml folder; 
what Build action did you set on it?

Default should be AndroidResource, but it wouldn't help to verify...

This won't work/ xDoc.Load() wants a filename, and there is no such file. Files 
with a Build action of AndroidResource are embedded into the .apk and are not 
extracted at install time; in order to access such files, you need to use the 
Resources [0, 1] API:

	var doc = new XmlDocument ();
	doc.Load (context.Resources.GetXml (Resource.Xml.Data));

Alternatively, instead of using the Android Resources API, you may want to 
embed the file into your assembly. This will allow your code to be portable 
across Windows and MonoTouch as well. You'd set the Build action for Data.xml 
to EmbeddedResource, and use Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream()[2]:

	var doc = new XmlDocument ();
	doc.Load (Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly ().GetManifestResourceStream (@RESOURCE_NAME@));

Note: You'll need to double-check/change the Resource ID when using the 
EmbeddedResource build action, as @RESOURCE_NAME@ frequently will NOT be the 
filename; see the file's Properties panel.

ave got it by using a streamReader and indicating the correct url of my
file after trying a lot of combinations... However I will try your ad Jon,
it`s quite simple too.


wnt to use xml file as data storage...can any one tell me how to
store data to xml file from mono for android edit texts ....i have 2 edit
text controls when i click on save button the data in the edit text have to
store into the xml file...m very new to mono for android...where to create
xml file and where to write code


The (internal) creation of the XML file is the same in monodroid as it is in 
C# as is the reading and writing to the device (XmlReader and XmlWriter classes).

The creation is simple enough. I'll call your save button btnSave for argument
here with the EditText controls edit1 and edit2

btnSave.Click += delegate { saveToXml(edit1.Text, edit2.Text); };

private void saveToXml(string text1, string text2)
{
string path = System.IO.Path.Combine(System.Environment.GetFolderPath 
(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments),"myXMLfile.xml");
try
{
XmlTextWriter textWriter = new XmlTextWriter(path);
textWriter.WriteStartDocument();
textWriter.WriteStartElement("string1");
textWriter.WriteStartElement(text1);
textWriter.WriteEndElement();
textWriter.WriteStartElement("string2");
textWriter.WriteStartElement(text2);
textWriter.WriteEndElement();
textWriter.WriteEndDocument();
textWriter.Close();
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
Console.WriteLine("Exception thrown : {0}", ex.Message);
}
}

(or however you want to write the XML document - this is a quick and simple method)

You will need it have

using System.Xml;

at the start of the file 



XmlTextWriter textWriter = new XmlTextWriter(path);
 i m getting error at instantiation...new XmlTextWriter(path);....
the error is:
XmlTextWriter.XmlTextWriter(TextWriter writer) (+2 overload(s))
 Error:
 the best overloaded method match for
'System.Xml.XmlTextWriter.XmlTextWriter(System.IO.TextWriter)' has some
invalid arguments
i have
using System.Xml;
using System.IO;
but i m getting error at new XmlTextWriter(path)
