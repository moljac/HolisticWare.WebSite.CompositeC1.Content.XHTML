 created an application using MonoDevelop. I used GTK#. It runs fine in the
debugger. Now I want to make an installer for ubuntu, windows and mac. But I
can not figure how I should do this.

or Windows, I use InnoSetup, but there are other free installer makers.  You'll need to 
figure out the steps required to install your application and the files needed.

For ubuntu, you'll have to learn how ubuntu installs things.  I'm more familiar with 
Fedora - on Fedora, you must make an RPM through use of a .spec file.  You can include the 
files for the application and pre/post installation scripts.




asked the same basic question here:

Gist: look to a successful cross-platform example, like Banshee.

I haven't done this yet, but if there is anyone that would like to
work together on any aspect of this (making it easy, developing tools,
documentation, etc) I'd be willing to help.


Add the Gtk DLL to the resources (i.e. resx).

Monodevelop SHOULD have plain text source compilation, like with CPP, built-in; 
otherwise, it is the incremental build option in Visual Studio with .bat files enabled 
on primary compilation stage.

No need for the hadoop on .bat files. Save your breath.
