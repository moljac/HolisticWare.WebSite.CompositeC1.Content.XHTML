BTW - The way I got monodevelop to run was as follows:
1) Set up a parallel build environemnt (installed mono with a prefix 
directory and setup environment with shell script) so it installed 'local'..
2) ran make/make install
3) went into old /usr/lib/mono/gac, and ran something like
find . -name *.dll -print| xargs -n1 gacutil /i
4) went back into mono build directory and reran make install so it 
would overwrite any old mono dlls, and presumably re-register them (not 
sure this was necessary, but it might have been).
5) then ran "mono /usr/lib/monodevelop/bin/MonoDevelop.exe' with local 
copy of mono.
