> 1. Is it bad/good style to have a public class that implements global variables?

How do you define "global variable"? 

`public static` fields are Very Bad?, unless they're `readonly`. This is because there's no way 
to prevent modification of the field from anything else in your process.

`public static` properties are (generally) fine, and are common in the Base Class Library.

Best, though, is to keep things `internal` or `private` unless they _really_ need to be public.

> My program readys a DB connection right at the start which is queried by multiple different 
GTK windows.

This is a case where `internal` should normally be preferred over `public`, unless another 
assembly in your app needs access to the value.















Be carefull about this way of working with DB. You must free the connections as fast 
as you can and I'm not sure you can do like this way. 

What happen if you dispose the connection ? That would be the usual way of freeing 
the queue (or thru the 'using' blocks).
