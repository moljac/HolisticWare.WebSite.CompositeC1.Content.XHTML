<p>
	Reasoning about code means being able to follow the execution path ("running the
	program in your head") while knowing what the goal of the code is.</p>
<h4>
	<a id="TOC-Symptoms"></a>Symptoms</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The presence of "voodoo code", or code that has no effect on the goal of the program
		but is diligently maintained anyway (such as initializing variables that are never
		used, calling functions that are irrelevant to the goal, producing output that is
		not used, etc.)</li><li>Executing idempotent functions multiple times (eg: calling the
			save() function multiple times "just to be sure")</li><li>Fixing bugs by writing code
				that overwrites the result of the faulty code</li><li>"Yo-Yo code" that converts a value
					into a different representation, then converts it back to where it started (eg:
					converting a decimal into a string and then back into a decimal, or padding a string
					and then trimming it)</li><li>"Bulldozer code" that gives the appearance of refactoring
						by breaking out chunks into subroutines, but that are impossible to reuse in another
						context (very high cohesion)</li></ol>

	<a id="TOC-Remedies"></a>Remedies</h4>
<p>
	To get over this deficiency a programmer can practice by using the IDE's own debugger
	as an aide, if it has the ability to step through the code one line at a time. In
	Visual Studio, for example, this means setting a breakpoint at the beginning of
	the problem area and stepping through with the 'F11' key, inspecting the value of
	variables--before and after they change--until you understand what the code is doing.
	If the target environment doesn't have such a feature, then do your practice-work
	in one that does.</p>
<p>
	The goal is to reach a point where you no longer need the debugger to be able to
	follow the flow of code in your head, and where you are patient enough to think
	about what the code is doing to the state of the program. The reward is the ability
	to identify redundant and unnecessary code, as well as how to find bugs in existing
	code without having to re-implement the whole routine from scratch.</p>
<h3><a id="">
	<a id="TOC-2.-Poor-understanding-of-the-langua"></a>2. Poor understanding of the
	language's programming model</a></h3>
<p>
	Object Oriented Programming is an example of a language model, as is Functional
	or Declarative programming. They're each significantly different from procedural
	or imperative programming, just as procedural programming is significantly different
	from assembly or GOTO-based programming. Then there are languages which follow a
	major programming model (such as OOP) but introduce their own improvements such
	as list comprehensions, generics, duck-typing, etc.</p>
<h4>
	<a id="TOC-Symptoms1"></a>Symptoms</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Using whatever syntax is necessary to break out of the model, then writing the remainder
		of the program in their familiar language's style</li><li>(OOP) Attempting to call non-static
			functions or variables in uninstantiated classes, and having difficulty understanding
			why it won't compile</li><li>(OOP) Writing lots of "xxxxxManager" classes that contain
				all of the methods for manipulating the fields of objects that have little or no
				methods of their own</li><li>(Relational) Treating a relational database as an object
					store and performing all joins and relation enforcement in client code</li><li>(Functional)
						Creating multiple versions of the same algorithm to handle different types or operators,
						rather than passing high-level functions to a generic implementation</li><li>(Functional)
							Manually caching the results of a deterministic function on platforms that do it
							automatically (such as SQL and Haskell)</li><li>Using cut-n-paste code from someone
								else's program to deal with I/O and Monads</li><li>(Declarative) Setting individual
									values in imperative code rather than using data-binding</li></ol>

<p>
	If your skills deficiency is a product of ineffective teaching or studying, then
	an alternative teacher is the compiler itself. There is no more effective way of
	learning a new programming model than starting a new project and committing yourself
	to use whatever the new constructs are, intelligently or not. You also need to practice
	explaining the model's features in crude terms of whatever you are familiar with,
	then recursively building on your new vocabulary until you understand the subtleties
	as well. For example:</p>
<p>
	Phase 1: "OOP is just records with methods"
	<br />
	Phase 2: "OOP methods are just functions running in a mini-program with its own
	global variables"
	<br />
	Phase 3: "The global variables are called fields, some of which are private and
	invisible from outside the mini-program"
	<br />
	Phase 4: "The idea of having private and public elements is to hide implementation
	details and expose a clean interface, and this is called Encapsulation"
	<br />
	Phase 5: "Encapsulation means my business logic doesn't need to be polluted with
	implementation details"</p>
<p>
	Phase 5 looks the same for all languages, since they are all really trying to get
	the programmer to the point where he can express the <em>intent</em> of the program
	without burying it in the specifics of <em>how</em>. Take functional programming
	as another example:</p>
<p>
	Phase 1: "Functional programming is just doing everything by chaining deterministic
	functions together"
	<br />
	Phase 2: "When the functions are deterministic the compiler can predict when it
	can cache results or skip evaluation, and even when it's safe to prematurely stop
	evaluation"
	<br />
	Phase 3: "In order to support Lazy and Partial Evaluation, the compiler requires
	that functions are defined in terms of how to transform a single parameter, sometimes
	into another function. This is called Currying"
	<br />
	Phase 4: "Sometimes the compiler can do the Currying for me"
	<br />
	Phase 5: "By letting the compiler figure out the mundane details, I can write programs
	by describing <em>what</em> I want, rather than <em>how</em> to give it to me"</p>

	/ Chronically poor knowledge of the platform's features</a></h3>
<p>
	Modern languages and frameworks now come with an awesome breadth and depth of built-in
	commands and features, with some leading frameworks (Java, .Net, Cocoa) being too
	large to expect any programmer, even a good one, to learn in anything less than
	a few years. But a good programmer will search for a built-in function that does
	what they need before they begin to roll their own, and excellent programmers have
	the skill to break-down and identify the abstract problems in their task, then search
	for existing frameworks, patterns, models and languages that can be adapted before
	they even begin to design the program.</p>
<h4>
	<a id="TOC-Symptoms2"></a>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
	These are only indicative of the problem if they continue to appear in the programmer's
	work long after he should have mastered the new platform.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Re-inventing or laboring without basic mechanisms that are built-into the language,
		such as events-and-handlers or regular expressions</li><li>Re-inventing classes and
			functions that are built-into the framework (eg: timers, collections, sorting and
			searching algorithms) *</li><li>"Email me teh code, plz" messages posted to help forums</li><li>
				"Roundabout code" that accomplishes in many instructions what could be done with
				far fewer (eg: rounding a number by converting a decimal into a formatted string,
				then converting the string back into a decimal)</li><li>Persistently using old-fashioned
					techniques even when new techniques are better in those situations (eg: still writes
					named delegate functions instead of using lambda expressions)</li><li>Having a stark
						"comfort zone", and going to extreme lengths to solve complex problems with primitives</li></ol>
<p>
	* - Accidental duplication will also happen, proportionate to the size of the framework,
	so judge by degree. Someone who hand-rolls a linked list <i>might</i> Know What
	They Are Doing, but someone who hand-rolls their own StrCpy() probably does not.</p>

	A programmer can't acquire this kind of knowledge without slowing down, and it's
	likely that he's been in a rush to get each function working by whatever means necessary.
	He needs to have the platform's technical reference handy and be able to look through
	it with minimal effort, which can mean either having a hard copy of it on the desk
	right next to the keyboard, or having a second monitor dedicated to a browser. To
	get into the habit initially, he should refactor his old code with the goal of reducing
	its instruction count by 10:1 or more.</p>

	<a id="TOC-4.-Inability-to-comprehend-pointers"></a>4. Inability to comprehend
	pointers</a></h3>
<p>
	If you don't understand pointers then there is a very shallow ceiling on the types
	of programs you can write, as the concept of pointers enables the creation of complex
	data structures and efficient APIs. Managed languages use references instead of
	pointers, which are similar but add automatic dereferencing and prohibit pointer
	arithmetic to eliminate certain classes of bugs. They are still similar enough,
	however, that a failure to grasp the concept will be reflected in poor data-structure
	design and bugs that trace back to the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
	in method calls.</p>
<h4>
	<a id="TOC-Symptoms3"></a>Symptoms</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Failure to implement a linked list, or write code that inserts/deletes nodes from
		linked list or tree without losing data</li><li>Allocating arbitrarily big arrays for

			rather than using a dynamic data structure</li><li>Inability to find or fix bugs caused
				by mistakenly performing arithmetic on pointers</li><li>Modifying the dereferenced values
					from pointers passed as the parameters to a function, and not expecting it to change
					the values in the scope outside the function</li><li>Making a copy of a pointer, changing
						the dereferenced value via the copy, then assuming the original pointer still points
						to the old value</li><li>Serializing a pointer to the disk or network when it should

		Pointers can be described with many different metaphors, and data structures into
		many analogies. The above is a simple analogy for a linked list, and anybody can
		invent their own, even if they aren't programmers. The comprehension failure doesn't
		occur when pointers are described, so you can't describe them any more thoroughly
		than they already have been. It fails when the programmer then tries to visualize
		what's going on in the computer's memory and gets it conflated with their understanding
		of regular variables, which are very similar. It may help to translate the code
		into a simple story to help reason about what's going on, until the distinction
		clicks and the programmer can visualize pointers and the data structures they enable
		as intuitively as scalar values and arrays.</p>

		recursion</a></h3>
	<p>
		The idea of recursion is easy enough to understand, but programmers often have problems
		imagining the result of a recursive operation in their minds, or how a complex result
		can be computed with a simple function. This makes it harder to design a recursive
		function because you have trouble picturing "where you are" when you come to writing
		the test for the base condition or the parameters for the recursive call.</p>
	<h4>
		<a id="TOC-Symptoms4"></a>Symptoms</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Hideously complex iterative algorithms for problems that can be solved recursively
			(eg: traversing a filesystem tree), especially where memory and performance is not
			a premium</li><li>Recursive functions that check the same base condition both before
				and after the recursive call</li><li>Recursive functions that don't test for a base
					condition</li><li>Recursive subroutines that concatenate/sum to a global variable or
						a carry-along output variable</li><li>Apparent confusion about what to pass as the parameter
							in the recursive call, or recursive calls that pass the parameter unmodified</li><li>
								Thinking that the number of iterations is going to be passed as a parameter</li></ol>
	<h4>
		<a id="TOC-Remedies4"></a>Remedies</h4>
	<p>
		Get your feet wet and be prepared for some stack overflows. Begin by writing code
		with only one base-condition check and one recursive call that uses the same, unmodified
		parameter that was passed. Stop coding even if you have the feeling that it's not
		enough, and run it anyway. It throws a stack-overflow exception, so now go back
		and pass a modified copy of the parameter in the recursive call. More stack overflows?
		Excessive output? Then do more code-and-run iterations, switching from tweaking
		your base-condition test to tweaking your recursive call until you start to intuit
		how the function is transforming its input. Resist the urge to use more than one
		base-condition test or recursive call unless you really Know What You're Doing.</p>
	<p>
		Your goal is to have the confidence to jump in, even if you don't have a complete
		sense of "where you are" in the imaginary recursive path. Then when you need to
		write a function for a real project you'd begin by writing a unit test first, and
		proceeding with the same technique above.</p>

		Imagine your program's input is water. It's going to fall through every crack and

	<p>
		You will need to make yourself familiar with the mechanisms on your platform that

	<ol>
		<li>those which stop the program before any damage is done when something unexpected

	<h4>
		<a id="TOC-Remedies9"></a>Remedies</h4>
	<p>
		The following only covers basic principles, but they'll avoid most of the egregious
		errors that can compromise an entire system. For any system that handles or stores
		information of value to you or its users, or that controls a valuable resource,
		<strong>always have a security professional review the design and implementation</strong>.</p>
	<p>
		Begin by auditing your programs for code that stores input in an array or other
		kind of allocated memory and make sure it checks that the size of the input doesn't
		exceed the memory allocated for storing it. No other class of bug has caused more
		exploitable security holes than the buffer overflow, and to such an extent that
		you should seriously consider a memory-managed language when writing network programs,
		or anywhere security is a priority.</p>
	<p>
		Next, audit for database queries that concatenate unmodified input into the body
		of a SQL query and switch to using parameterized queries if the platform supports
		it, or filter/escape all input if not. This is to prevent SQL-injection attacks.</p>
	<p>
		After you've de-fanged the two most infamous classes of security bug you should
		continue thinking about all program input as completely untrustworthy and potentially
		malicious. It's important to define your program's acceptable input in the form
		of working validation code, and your program should reject input unless it passes
		validation so that you can fix exploitable holes by fixing the validation and making
		it more specific, rather than scanning for the signatures of known exploits.</p>
	<p>
		Going further, you should always think about what operations your program needs
		to perform and the privileges it'll need from the host to do them before you even
		begin designing it, because this is the best opportunity to figure out how to write
		the program to use the fewest privileges possible. The principle behind this is
		to limit the damage that could be caused to the rest of the system if an exploitable
		bug was found in your code. In other words: after you've learned not to trust your
		input you should also learn not to trust your own programs.</p>
	<p>
		The last you should learn are the basics of encryption, beginning with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle"
			rel="nofollow" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none">Kerckhoff's principle</a>.
		It can be expressed as "the security should be in the key", and there are a couple
		of interesting points to derive from it.</p>
	<p>
		The first is that you should never trust a cipher or other crypto primitive unless
		it is published openly and has been analyzed and tested extensively by the greater
		security community. There is no security in obscurity, proprietary, or newness,
		as far as cryptography goes. Even implementations of trusted crypto primitives can
		have flaws, so avoid implementations you aren't sure have been thoroughly reviewed
		(including your own). All new cryptosystems enter a pipeline of scrutiny that can
		be a decade long or more, and you want to limit yourself to the ones that come out
		of the end with all their known faults fixed.</p>
	<p>
		The second is that if the key is weak, or stored improperly, then it's as bad as
		having no encryption at all. If your program needs to encrypt data, but not decrypt
		it, or decrypt only on rare occasions, then consider giving it only the public key
		of an asymmetric cipher key pair and making the decryption stage run separately
		with the private key secured with a good passphrase that the user must enter each
		time.</p>
	<p>
		The more is at stake, then the more homework you need to do and the more thought
		you must put into the design phase of the program, all because security is the one
		feature that dozens, sometimes millions of uninvited people will try to break after
		your program has been deployed.</p>
	<p>
		The vast majority of security failures traceable to code have been due to silly
		mistakes, most of which can be avoided by screening input, using resources conservatively,
		using common sense, and writing code no faster than you can think and reason about
		it.</p>

		<div>
			Programmers in a hurry (or The Zone) commit all these crimes and come back to clean
			it up later, but a bad programmer is just sloppy. Sometimes it helps to use an IDE
			that can fix indentation and whitespace ("pretty print") with a shortcut key, but
			I've seen programmers who can even bludgeon Visual Studio's insistence on proper
			indentation by messing around with the code too much.</div>

	<p>
		Programming could still be a hobby for you, but it would be in society's best interests
		to defend itself against your entry into the world of professional software development.</p>
	<h4>
		<a id="TOC-Symptoms14"></a>Symptoms</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>You aren't interested in fixing a bug that can be worked around by rebooting the
			computer</li><li>Your installation program silently deploys unsolicited third party
				programs that are unrelated to the function of yours *</li><li>You don't use any ergonomic
					model when designing user interfaces, nor do you have any interest in usability
					studies</li><li>Your program exhibits pretension and grandeur beyond its utility, eg:
						displaying splash screens over active programs while loading in the background,
						or placing multiple launch icons in premium desktop locations *</li><li>Your program
							produces output to be read by another (eg: a browser), or implements a network protocol,
							and relies on the other party's software to be significantly tolerant to spec violations</li><li>
								You write busy-wait loops even when the platform offers event-driven programming</li><li>
									You don't use managed languages and can't be bothered to do bounds checking or input
									validation</li><li>Your user interfaces do not make the difficulty of accidentally invoking
										a function proportionate to its destructiveness (eg: the "Delete Database" button
										is next to "Save", just as big, has no confirmation step and no undo)</li><li>You don't
											use whitespace, indentation or comments</li></ol>
	<p>
		* - These are actually imposed by management more often than by the programmer,
		who only implements them. We'd still group them together for the sake of this self-test,
		though, and at the most suggest that one seek employment at a better firm, while
		the other goes back to business school to learn less destructive ways of making
		a profit.</p>
