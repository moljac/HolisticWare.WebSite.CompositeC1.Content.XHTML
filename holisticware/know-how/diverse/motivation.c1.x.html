	<li><b>Be generous with praise.</b> Everyone wants it and it’s one of the easiest 
		things to give. Plus, praise from the CEO goes a lot farther than you might 
		think. Praise every improvement that you see your team members make. Once you’re 
		comfortable delivering praise one-on-one to an employee, try praising them in 
		front of others. </li>
	<li><b>Get rid of the managers. </b>Projects without project managers? That doesn’t 
		seem right! Try it. Removing the project lead or supervisor and empowering your 
		staff to work together as a team rather then everyone reporting to one 
		individual can do wonders. Think about it. What’s worse than letting your 
		supervisor down? Letting your team down! Allowing people to work together as a 
		team, on an equal level with their co-workers, will often produce better 
		projects faster. People will come in early, stay late, and devote more of their 
		energy to solving problems. </li>
	<li><b>Make your ideas theirs.</b> People hate being told what to do. Instead of 
		telling people what you want done; ask them in a way that will make them feel 
		like they came up with the idea. “I’d like you to do it this way” turns into “Do 
		you think it’s a good idea if we do it this way?” </li>
	<li><b>Never criticize or correct.</b> No one, and I mean no one, wants to hear that 
		they did something wrong. If you’re looking for a de-motivator, this is it. Try 
		an indirect approach to get people to improve, learn from their mistakes, and 
		fix them. Ask, “Was that the best way to approach the problem? Why not? Have any 
		ideas on what you could have done differently?” Then you’re having a 
		conversation and talking through solutions, not pointing a finger. </li>
	<li><b>Make everyone a leader.</b> Highlight your top performers’ strengths and let 
		them know that because of their excellence, you want them to be the example for 
		others. You’ll set the bar high and they’ll be motivated to live up to their 
		reputation as a leader. </li>
	<li><b>Take an employee to lunch once a week.</b> Surprise them. Don’t make an 
		announcement that you’re establishing a new policy. Literally walk up to one of 
		your employees, and invite them to lunch with you. It’s an easy way to remind 
		them that you notice and appreciate their work. </li>
	<li><b>Give recognition and small rewards.</b> These two things come in many forms: 
		Give a shout out to someone in a company meeting for what she has accomplished. 
		Run contests or internal games and keep track of the results on a whiteboard 
		that everyone can see. Tangible awards that don’t break the bank can work too. 
		Try things like dinner, trophies, spa services, and plaques.<b> </b></li>
	<li><b>Throw company parties.</b> Doing things as a group can go a long way. Have a 
		company picnic. Organize birthday parties. Hold a happy hour. Don’t just wait 
		until the holidays to do a company activity; organize events throughout the year 
		to remind your staff that you’re all in it together.<b> </b></li>
	<li><b>Share the rewards—and the pain.</b> When your company does well, celebrate. 
		This is the best time to let everyone know that you’re thankful for their hard 
		work. Go out of your way to show how far you will go when people help your 
		company succeed. If there are disappointments, share those too. If you expect 
		high performance, your team deserves to know where the company stands. Be honest 
		and transparent.</li>
