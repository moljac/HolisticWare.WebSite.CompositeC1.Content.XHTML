Outsourcing - team or single dev



This is a very interesting question. Generally people will go with a single experienced dev to reduce costs in the projects they want to have done. That's the obvious point. However, everything is a tradeoff. Buying the time and expertise of a single individual means you also buy into all the accompanying risk factors: what if something happens to him/her? is he truly reliable and confidential? How much MORE time will this take? Without further eyeballs looking at the QA process, what slipups will I need to deal with after its all done?
 
Like its always said. You generally get what you pay for. 

I met with a friend of mine last year who hired a developer to get her iOS game done. The dev was from India I think and he promised the rather simple app would be completed in 2 months and he would do it for $2000 USD. A bargain! All the signs said that he was quite experienced and reliable when he got through the multiple interviews she set up in an attempt to avoid getting caught in a bad deal. Turned out after 3 months, the app was not completed and the man was asking for $1500 more or he would not finish the project. In the best scenario, he underestimated the time he needed to spend on the app to complete it properly (in the worst, he scammed my friend). Its now been more than 8 months since that project started and I believe the app is "almost done". I don't know how much more money was thrown at it and I know at least 1 other developer was given the job (transfer).
 
The point is, a company will charge more, yes, but its way easier to validate their quality and credentials. They have more staff to transfer the workload to and more specialized individuals to look after all aspects of the dev process. Some are not as good as others, some will over cost you and others will be really, really good too, but likely you can place your bet with more assurance and... again, get what you pay for.
 
So my recommendation is this: if you don't mind taking chances with timeline and money, go with a developer and work your way to a successful app, and cross your fingers if you can. If you are serious about app development, contact a reputable company with a good track record and get things done the right way.
 
If you need more advice or you need your app coded right, feel free to contact me. I own Sylien Games, a web and smartphone app development company in Canada (with 130 apps devved so far), and 123 Startup Solutions a startup coaching company that helps people get things off the ground.

My take on this is that when it comes down to signing NDA ect. if someone over seas were to take your idea, I'm not familiar with the laws to sue someone. In addition, time management will be a huge factor when trying to communicate effectively.
 
Thank you for your story it broaden my prospective on the app business. 

And i appreciate your offer, but im going to do a little research for local businesses, who can develop my app. Again that you Sylvain Rochon you've been a great help
