							<li><b>Model the verbs first, then the nouns</b><br />
								Design classes that represent <i>requests, transfers, responses</i> and so-on. 
								Don&#39;t begin by creating classes for <i>customer, employee, vehicle</i> until 
								your progress with the verbs has made it clear what properties and behavior 
								needs to be in them, and what doesn&#39;t<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Model the solution, not the feature</b><br />
								If you&#39;re making classes like <i>ReportPrinter</i> or <i>ProfitCalculator</i> 
								then you&#39;re doing it wrong. You want a <i>Report</i> class and a <i>Printer</i> 
								class, or a <i>Ledger</i> class and a <i>ProfitAndLossReport</i> class<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>The domain is not reality</b><br />
								A &quot;domain&quot; is an imaginary representation of the problem for the sake of 
								constructing a solution. Sometimes you don&#39;t need an object for &quot;person&quot; if 
								&quot;transaction&quot; is what you&#39;re really dealing with. Unless you&#39;re writing a sequel 
								to The Sims, you will want to model an abstract world that has been contrived to 
								represent what the software is meant to do<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b><code>Report.ToPrinter()</code> is wrong, </b>
								<span style="font-weight: bold;"><code>Report.ToPostscript()</code> is right</span><br />
								Do not do <code>Report.ToPrinter(Laserjet)</code>, do
								<font face="arial, sans-serif"><code>Laserjet.Print(Report)</code>and have the 
								Print() method accept an object that implements a ToPostscript (or ToPDF) 
								interface. Data classes should have methods that serialize their contents to 
								well-known intermediate formats (strings, csv, XML and so-on) in order to write 
								themselves to output devices. They shouldn&#39;t have code that&#39;s specific to any 
								particular output device<br />
								<br />
								</font></li>
							<li><b><code>Customer.ToPostscript()</code> is wrong, <code>Laserjet.Print(new 
								CustomerReport(Customer))</code> is right</b><br />
								The more abstract the concept is, the less it should assume how it&#39;ll be used. A
								<i>Report</i> can presume to be printed and need a way to render itself in a 
								common printer format, but a <i>Customer</i> object could be used for far more. 
								Create classes that wrap abstract data to give them concrete purposes on demand<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Inheritance is not how you reuse code</b><br />
								Inheritance is how you show &quot;<i>is a&quot;</i> relationships in your taxonomy of 
								data, it only accidentally has the benefit of reusing code. Do not create 
								abstract classes just to cram utility functions in them. Inheritance is a 
								mechanism that <i>enables</i> ways of code reuse by boiling down the essentials 
								of a data-type to the minimum a particular method needs to work with it. For 
								example, the next tip:<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b><code>public void Print(Report myReport)</code> is wrong, <code>public void 
								Print(IPrintable myDocument)</code> is right</b><br />
								Don&#39;t be afraid to use as many interfaces as you need to show the ways an object 
								can interact with other parts of the program. Interfaces should also be as 
								minimal and specific as possible, and it is not unusual for some classes to 
								implement as many as 5 or 6 of them<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b><i>Car</i> does not inherit from <i>ParkingLot</i></b><br />
								Only use inheritance if the descendant class is truly a <i>kind of</i> parent 
								class. If you&#39;re trying to join the two concepts together, consider using <i>
								composition</i> so that ParkingLot has a <i>collection of</i> Car objects<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Methods hate state</b><br />
								Unless it imports, exports, or modifies the state of an object, every class&#39;s 
								methods should be given what they need only as parameters in the method call. Do 
								not do <code>private void ProcessData()</code>, do <code>private bool 
								ProcessData(out IEnumerable input)</code>, even if <i>input</i> is a property or 
								field of the same class. During refactoring, you&#39;ll figure out where ProcessData 
								should really live, and it&#39;ll be easier to move it there<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Classes shouldn&#39;t be peg-boards</b><br />
								Publicly <i>gettable</i> properties are fine, and in some cases it&#39;s also 
								necessary to have a publicly <i>settable</i> property, too. But before you make 
								too many of them, think about whether the value of the property can be passed in 
								the constructor or calculated from other data the class already has<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Look for opportunities to keep it <code>static</code></b><br />
								Many persistence layers (filesystems, databases, etc) already do caching for 
								you, so why cache it again in the state of an instantiated object? Look for 
								situations where it makes sense to have a <code>static</code> class with get/set 
								methods that take the entity&#39;s ID as a parameter. Here are some examples:<ul>
									<li>Counters that return/update an integer value to disk (the filesystem or drive 
										controller will likely store the entire file in cache)</li>
									<li>Lookup / configuration tables (your DBM will cache the most frequently requested 
										rows)</li>
									<li>Entities that don&#39;t have children, or aren&#39;t part of a tree or graph structure<br />
										<br />
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><b>Dogs should know it&#39;s not bacon</b><br />
								Input validation should be performed within the property setters of the objects 
								that are encapsulating the input (and not the constructors), but they should 
								only use the resources that are immediately available to them for it; ie: don&#39;t 
								stash database connections around in your entity classes just so you can check a 
								lookup table; in such cases you&#39;d pass that back to another layer<br />
								<br />
							</li>
							<li><b>Tables are not classes</b><br />
								As convenient as it may be to have ActiveRecords, you should not just run an
								<a href="http://www.yacoset.com/Home/glossary">ORM</a> over all your database 
								tables and call it a day. The most appropriate relational model for your data 
								will not fit the most appropriate <i>object</i> model for the same data. Your 
								class for <i>Order</i> should not just contain the same properties as your <i>
								orders</i> table has for columns, it should know what constitutes a valid order 
								(do the totals add up?) and what state it&#39;s in (pending, paid, shipped, etc). It 
								may even hide data that&#39;s visible in the database but out-of-scope for the 
								program, yet expose data that&#39;s in a separate store and <i>is</i> in scope<ul>
									<li><b>Use an ORM that makes <code>partial</code> classes</b><br />
										LINQ-to-SQL and other Object-Relational Mappers will generate a class for every 
										table, but those classes will be <code>partial</code>. Start putting relevant 
										logic and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" rel="nofollow">
										Law-Of-Demeter</a> shortcuts into your custom side of the partial class</li>
