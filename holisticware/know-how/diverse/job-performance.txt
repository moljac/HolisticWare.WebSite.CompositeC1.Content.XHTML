imho, paying based on productivity is a wrong approach to increase productivity in a company for several reasons. I'll present just two: 

First of all, money is an extrinsic reward. For a basic discussion on intrinsic vs extrinsic reward, please take a look at the Wikipedia article: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation 

In that discussion you can read that the use of extrinsic motivators leads to overjustification and reduction of intrinsic motivation, so once the extrinsic motivator disappears (money) the motivation to do the activity disappears. If you want people to excel at what they do, you must use intrinsic motivators, and self-determination theory tells us that motivating intrinsically involves autonomy, mastery and purpose (nothing about money). Take a look at this video where Daniel Pink explains this, as an overview of his book "Drive":

In addition, a company is a complex system. In a complex system you can't optimize the whole optimizing the parts (that's what you do with compensations based on performance). The only way to optimize the whole is to optimize the INTERACTIONS among the parts. Regarding this I recommend you to take a look at the talk "Why management is dispensable" by Niels Pflaeging:

The conclusion is that the only way to improve a company performance is to improve employee happiness, and that doesn't involve at all paying based on performance. HTH to people trying to make their companies better.
