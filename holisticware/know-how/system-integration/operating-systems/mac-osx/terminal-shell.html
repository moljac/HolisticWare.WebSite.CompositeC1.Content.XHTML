	<h2><a id="">Problems when copying from network share (windows SMB, samba) or Cloud storage (Dropbox)</a></h2>
	<p>
		Mac OSX puts files from network (internet, shares, cloud storage) into quarantine.
	</p>
	<p>
		When moving files from Windows shared folder
	</p>
	<pre class="hw_code">
#$ ./build-pjsip.sh 
# -bash: ./build-pjsip.sh: Operation not permitted
#$  ls -@Oel ./build-pjsip.sh

	</pre>
	<p>
		Remove the quarantine attribute from your files as follows:
	</p>
	<pre class="hw_code"> 
find ~ -exec xattr -d com.apple.quarantine {} 2> /dev/null \;
sudo find . -name "*.sh" -exec xattr -d com.apple.quarantine {} \;

find . -flags +uchg -print0 | xargs -0 chflags nouchg

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./build-pjsip.sh 
	</pre>
	<p>
		Characters '+' and the '@' are indicating extended attributes,
		which can be managed using the xattr command. 
		<br />
		Cause of error was following extended attribute
	</p>
	<pre class="hw_code"> 
com.apple.quarantine
	</pre> 
	<p>
	To get rid of the error and get the script to work again, delete those 
	attributes using:
	</p>
	<pre class="hw_code"> 
	xattr -d com.apple.quarantine script.sh 
	</pre>	
	<p>
	This attribute was set without any interaction of user. Does anyone know if Apple 
	has build in some new security stuff with 10.7.3? 
	Or is this just accidential and some other action, which I am not aware of, 
	has changed or added the extended attributes?

	scripts are part of an automated process and it took some days till I 
	noted that this process does not work anymore, which resulted in data loss. 
	I was happy that those days data was not very important. Now I am afraid 
	that this may happen again any time :-(

	<h2><a id="">Changing shell</a></h2>
	<p>
		SHELL still pointing at /bin/tcsh. To fix that, you need to explicitly set SHELL in your 
		.bashrc file. 
		What you want is a .bash_profile like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="hw_code">
chsh -s /bin/bash


. ~/.bashrc
ENV=$HOME/.bashrc
export ENV

and .bashrc like this:

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin
alias lc=ls

SHELL=/bin/bash

	Drag that plist file to the desktop.

	Reboot, and your problem should be fixed.\
	
 me, the issue had to do with the Saved Application State, a new feature of Lion. It seemed to be confused as 
 to what was open and not open. But going in to the Library and clearing that folder out helped fix the issue. 
 Hope that helps someone.



No, but you might try using the Exposé command, F9 (or fn-F9) in these cases. That will show you all of your 
open apps in the Dock, all of your active windows, as well as all minimized windows. After pressing F9, 
you can navigate to any window, active or minimized, using the arrow keys.

If you're using Spaces, F9 will only show you the open and active windows in that Space, but it will also 
show you minimized windows from other Spaces (and it will show the Dock and all open apps).

	<h2><a id="">Shell scripts double click</a></h2>
	<pre class="hw_code">

need to be an administrative user to do these things:

- Create your shell script, with an editor that won't include extra characters (eg. pico in Terminal).
- In Terminal, make that script executable, eg. w/
chmod a+x [yourscriptname]
This will all be known to Terminal-savvy users so far.
But now:
- In Finder, locate the script and select Get Info (command-I) on it.
- Select Open With: Other...
- Change from Recommended Applications to All Applications.
- Browse to /Applications/Utilities and select Terminal.
- DO NOT select the Always Open With checkbox (unless you expressly want to associate a certain file 
  extension with Terminal -- really this would be a Very Bad Thing).
- After clicking Ok and closing Get Info, you should be able to simply double-click on the file in question 
from Finder and what will happen is, Terminal will open up and execute that very script.
If your script is non-interactive, ie. if it will just do something and then exit, the Terminal session 
will be finished as well (ie. you can't go on and type in further commands at the prompt). By default, 
the shell window will however stay open, allowing you to review any output from your script. Also, the 
actual Terminal application will NEVER quit automatically (though this is not much of a problem). 
There is one potential cosmetic problem:
If there is any output from your script, that will possibly already start to get written to the window 
while the initial shell prompt is still being written. This again is only a cosmetic problem in that it 
can jumble up what effectively gets displayed in the terminal screen. A workaround is to include 
sleep 1
clear
at the beginning of the script (before any output).
This just makes the thing literally wait a second (so that everything that might still get written 
to the shell has time to get written) and THEN clears the screen.
