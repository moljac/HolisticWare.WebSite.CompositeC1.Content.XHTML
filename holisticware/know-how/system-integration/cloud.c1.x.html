	<h2>Application platforms</h2>
	<p>
		In late 2012, in order to reduce costs and boost it's knowledge, HolisticWare team started
		activities on recent hype terms and one of them was "Cloud" and "Cloud Technologies". 
	</p>
	<p>
		Being predominantly .net and mono developers team members started to investigate cloud 
		application platforms for .net and mono. Primary properties that were investigated were
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			price (very important for HolisticWare and some of companies clients and partners)
		</li>
		<li>
			installation and deployment (complexity, support). 
			<br />
			This factor was tested with deployment of Composite C1 CMS system.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Following cloud application platforms were tested:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

1: Email

Email is the lifeblood of many organizations, and as a result, many companies 
are not willing to let go of it. That is understandable. But hosted email providers 
have moved beyond the days of packing 5,000 mailboxes belonging to 300 accounts 
onto a cheap computer running with a basic POP3/SMTP setup. While basic email 
service is still out there, you can get hosted Exchange services from a variety 
of vendors (if you need it), as well as some upscale, non-Exchange offerings. 
Email architecture has become quite standardized, and there is really no value-add 
to keeping it inside your firewall other than mitigating regulatory concerns.

2: Conferencing software

Setting up and maintaining conferencing software is not fun. To make matters worse, 
when it is down, it needs to be up in a hurry. Like email, there is zero benefit 
to locating this within your firewall. Also like email, the setup and configuration 
can be complex enough to require an expert, unless you don't mind tying up a staff 
member for a few days. For a low monthly or yearly fee, this weight can be off your 
shoulders. No one will notice or mind, and your staff can move on to other tasks.

3: CRM

The decision to outsource CRM can be scary. After all, like email, CRM is where so 
many of the company's crown jewels are stored. But there are no technical benefits 
or advantages to having CRM in-house. It's a fairly low bandwidth application with 
maintenance overhead you do not need. In addition, the licensing of many CRM systems 
can be a hassle. Moving to a hosted CRM system can free you to spend more time on 
more important issues.

4: Web hosting

Hosted Web space used to be as awful as hosted email, unless you were willing to 
spend big bucks on a dedicated server. Many vendors have shifted to (or offer) a 
virtualized hosting environment, which has dramatically increased uptime, reduced 
security risks, and allowed them to provide much more open and direct access to the 
servers. This is great news, especially for companies with custom applications that 
require a deployment path beyond copying some files over.

5: Development test labs

Building and maintaining test environments for software developers is a major 
undertaking. To do it right, you need all sorts of permutations of operating systems, 
patches, and relevant applications. You could easily find yourself with nearly 100 
test beds for a simple Web application, for example. Why do this to yourself when 
there are quality vendors out there who already have these test systems set up or 
that allow you to configure them with point-and-click ease? And you can safely give 
the keys to the development staff and know that they can't permanently mangle the 
test systems, too.

6: Video hosting

A few years ago, I was down on the idea of using the common video sites to host your 
video. Many companies would block those sites under the assumption that they were only 
for games, there was the real fear of having ads placed on your videos, and often the 
quality would be compromised. Now, the big name sites have upgraded their quality and 
few companies block them because there is plenty of legitimate usage. In addition, some 
sites allow you to pay a fairly low charge to give you more control over your video, 
like deciding where it can appear and enhancing its quality.

7: Email security

Even if you do not put your email with a hosted vendor, you will want to look at 
having a third party perform your anti-spam and antivirus duties, even if it's only 
as a first-line defense. If you look at how much incoming email is spam, you'll see 
that you can reduce your bandwidth needs dramatically by allowing a third party to 
perform an initial scan of your email. It will also allow you to have far fewer 
email servers. Speaking from personal experience, even a small company can have its 
email servers and network overwhelmed by incoming spam. Getting a good spam scanner 
outside the network can make a night-and-day difference.

8: Common application components

There is always the perpetual "build" vs. "buy" question for development projects, 
but the cloud adds a new wrinkle. Many functions that used to be the purview of 
components or libraries you could buy are now being made available as Web services, 
typically billed on a per-usage basis. Often, these services take a variety of 
lower-level functions and roll them into a complete, discrete offering. You would 
be surprised at how many of these Web services are available, and depending upon 
your usage scenario, it could make a good deal of sense to use them instead of 
rolling your own.

9: Basic office applications

If you need the full power of the Microsoft Office suite, by all means, this isn't 
for you. But if you are one of the many organizations that use only a small 
fraction of the Office feature set, it may make sense to look at one of the new 
crop of online Office replacements (or even Microsoft's online version of Office). 
I honestly never thought the day would come when this was possible, but it is a 
legitimate possibility for some companies. Just be honest with yourself before 
making this move and work closely with your users, since this directly affects 
so much of their workday.

10: Batch processing applications

One type of application that shines in the cloud are batch processing applications, 
such as data warehouses. As long as you can get the data needed into the cloud 
without disrupting your operations (such as "seeding" it with the shipment of 
physical media or synchronization over time), the ability to rapidly scale capacity 
in the cloud can result in tremendous savings. For example, if you need 15 servers' 
worth of computing capacity for a once-per-week job, do you really want to have 15 
servers sitting idle in your server room waiting for that? Or would you rather 
just modify the task to start 15 cloud instances, run the process, and shut them 
down again? In a scenario like this, it is clear that cloud computing can deliver 
significant advantages.
