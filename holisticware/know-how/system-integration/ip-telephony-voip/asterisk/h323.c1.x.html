need to follow the instructions in the README you find in channels/h323 in the source code. 
Pay attention to the version numbers of PWLIB and OPENH323. 
Ensure your environment variables are set to the right directories. 
After you compiled h323.o in the h323 directory you can "make menuselect" in the 
main directory of the source tree and within channels you should be able to add chan_h323.
 
Another option might be to enable ooh323 within the Add-Ons in "make menuselect" 
however I've never tried to go down that route. 




You can follow the following steps to configure h323 :- 
OOH323 installation with Asterisk :-
 
* First install pwlib
 
cd pwlib_v1_10_3 
./configure 
make opt 
make install
 
Follow the following steps before installing ooh323:- 
/usr/src/kernel/<linux version>/include/linux/compiler.h into 
/usr/include/linux
export PWLIBDIR=/usr/local/src/pwlib_v1_10_3 
cp $PWLIBDIR/lib/libpt_linux_x86_r.so.1.10.3 /usr/lib
 
(We copy the shared library manually into the system folder.
 
It is very important that you set the PWLIBDIR to your path, 
othewise OpenH323 will not find it.)
 

* cd openh323_v1_18_0
 
./configure 
make opt 
make install 
export OPENH323DIR=/usr/local/src/openh323_v1_18_0 
cp $OPENH323DIR/lib/libh323_linux_x86_r.so.1.18.0 /usr/lib 
cd ..
 
* asterisk-1.4.12.1
 
./configure 
make menuselect 
make 
make install 
make samples 
make config

also you need to check version of your gcc in README file. i found that some versions 
of gcc (from 4.x branch) didn't compiled pwlib. And i was needed to reinstall server to 
older version of centos 



recent update: 
i had already setup completely the h323 trunks (OOH323) but i have call issues. 

1. call from asterisk to avaya extension is successful but no audio. 
2. call from avaya to asterisk extension failed and i have this error 
denial event 1220: Recovery on timer expiry 

what went wrong? 


avaya is in my LAN.. asterisk is hosted (VPS).. i know the issue is mostly because of 
NAT traversal.
some claimed their setup work.. but i suspect because both are in the same network. 
 
 
 
 
 First you must resolve and be sure that is not NAT issue.
 If is not, then it must work without any problem
 Have you in your ooh323 exactly IP address of your interface?
 In my case it was problem, it better always to provide exactly IP address.
 

 
 
 Am using Asterisk 1.6.2.20 and using the exact IP address (public) for both. 

I can call my Avaya extension from asterisk but getting no audio. 
can't call from Avaya to asterisk.. gettting error "denial event 1220: 
Recovery on timer expiry"
 
This is also an ongoing debate on the Avaya group because of contradicting 
opinion on whats causing the issue.
 
I can't find any other problem except that it might be because of NAT.. 

I tried using VPN but i can't seem to make VPN work in Linux. 







In both calls the problem is in timer. Because the remote end did not 
respond to a message within the ISDN time constraints. 
Packet loss or packet delay in the network meaning the message either 
never got there or got back. You need to check a signaling port 
on both of stations.
