Does anyone know if in Asterisk if there is a way to use SIPAddHeader so that on a 
reply to say a call coming in, it will add the header? I know OpenSipS can do it but I 
want to tag the calls with a SIP header showing the Asterisk Channel.

In Asterisk SIP Headers works only on INVITE. So in case you receive and incoming 
call from OpenSIPS to Asterisk you can tell OpenSIPS about the channel information in 
a new invite i.e. another leg which is Asterisk-> OpenSIPS
