How to get the busy tone when third person is calling??????? I have 
install the asterisk on Linux Debian platform and its completely command 
based.. i am facing the one problem as follow:- 

When i make a call to another user and start to talk with him then i was 
able to talk with him but at this moment when third user try to make me 
call then at that time the third user get the ringtone instead of the 
busy tone. 

Disable the "call waiting" feature. I don't recall where it is via 
command line anymore, it has been too long. 

have the Command based asterisk so please tell me how can i do that. 

The another point is that may i use the Busy Lamp Field? 

If i can use then tell me how can i use it and how can i configure it in 
Asterisk? 

I have the one phone Grandstream GXP2120 that support the Busy Lamp 
Field. 

Please help me to out this. 

can use call limits to achieve this , simply add call-limit=1 to the 
account in sip.conf and make sure yout type is set to type=peer. As fas 
as the Busy Lamp is concerned . you will use HINTS. See this link :

Another option.... just disable the other 5 lines on the grandstream... 
But I agree with voipmagic, call-limit is the best option. 

Call limit is a poor option because then it means the phone can't make 
conference calls either. Just disable call waiting on the phone. It's in 
the Grandstream admin guide. If meetme is set-up in asterisk , 
call-limit will not affect the conference call because asterisk is doing 
the conferencing and NOT the phone.
