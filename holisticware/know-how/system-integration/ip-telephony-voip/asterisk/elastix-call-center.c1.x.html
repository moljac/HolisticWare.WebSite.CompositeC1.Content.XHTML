		<h3><a id="">
			To start outhoing calls from Call Center you need to setup few things :</a></h3>
		<p>
			- First you need to define agents who will make the calls (eg. Agent John Doe, ag.
			Number 1001)</p>
		<p>
			- Second is to define quees. In quees you define what Agents will be used in specific
			campaign. Actually you create a group of agents for certain or specific campaign.
			You can have multiple Quess or just one Quee with all your agents, depending of
			your needs. In example, if you have 2 outgoing campaigns and 7 Agents – you can
			scheduale 3 of your agents to work on first campaign and other 4 on other one. In
			next steps, when you are creating outgoing campaign you can assign specific quees
			to desired campaign.
		</p>
		<p>
			- Third is to make CSV file, so called &quot;calling file&quot;. In calling file
			you define what telephone numbers will be dialed in campaign (number, &quot;name&quot;,
			&quot;address&quot;). You define one calling file for each campaign.</p>
		<p>
			- Then you need to design Form. Form is something that will your Agent fill out
			during the conversation with the client (eg. His or her sex, date of birth, notes,
			occupation...)</p>
		<p>
			- Create outgoing campaign is to define what, who, when... In there you are &quot;connecting&quot;
			these things: forms (data collected from customes), calling file (who'm i'm gonna
			call), quees (which agnets will do the call ), script (what will they say) and you
			have additional options; start and end date, start time and end time.<br />
		</p>

		<h3><a id="">
			Additional operation for Call Center is;</a></h3>
		<p>
			- Configure Call Center module to connect with Elastix
		</p>
		<p>
			- Define Agent users for elastix (note this: for elastix, not for Call center!).
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				The thing is: If you are an agent you will have two logins: First you point your
				browser to elastix https://ip_address_of_Elastix(PBX) and login with Agent credentials.Its
				recommended to define Agent users with restricted privilegies, so that they can't
				see and mess with PBX or Call Center configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
				After Agent's login to elastix they see Agent's console where they need to enter
				their 4 digit agent number and their extension. Agent can be on whatever extension.
				For example, Agent 1 can do his campaign from extension 100 and 105. After loging
				in, agents console will appear. Call centre will automatically start outgoing campaign
				- dial desired numbers from CSV and assign calls to desired agents that you defind
				in quees. Also, Agnet will have his form to fill and he can see his script. More
				available options are break and call transfer.
