o get Skype working on Asterisk PBX, you should install Freeswitch and mod_skypopen. There is a lot of guides online, below I put some links. 
Idea is: 
1. Install freeswitch 
2. Install headless X server with VNC access 
3. Run skype instance(s) 
4. Configure freeswitch to talk with asterisk 

Performance is not best, but it works, on standard workstation, you may run about 5 skype clients. 
Stability is ... not best, you will need to create a series of scripts to monitor skype instances. 

If money is not a big problem, buy a commercial SIP support from skype. 

Some links, I have used to install Freeswitch:
