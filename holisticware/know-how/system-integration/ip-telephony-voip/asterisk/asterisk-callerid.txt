CallerId on Forwarded Calls.Can one set the returned calls to reflect the Extension’s name that you transferred the call to instead of having the original caller’s ID display.9 days agosimply use the Set() command in your dialplan: exten => forward,1,Set(CALLERID(num)=01234567890) Just one catch though ... If the callerid does not belong too you - your PSTN might not publish it or in the case of Landline providers - drop the call entirely.hanks man, but what i need is when you forward a call to an extension and when its not answered and comeback to reception for instance, it will return with the id of the extension where it was transferred to. Hope this explains my scenario better.It is still dialplan magic. You need to know how you sent the call to the extension. Was it a blind transfer directly, or a hunt group, or a ..... Did the call transfer back to you because their destination said "go here if I don't answer" or was it in ringing state and your dial command timed out? once you figure out what part of the code is in control at the time it comes back, you will know where to set the caller id.Try and see if this will work for you : [reception] exten => 100,1,Dial(SIP/100,,r) exten => _1XX,1,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30,tX) exten => _1XX,n,Goto(reception,${EXTEN},${DIALSTATUS}) exten => _1XX,n(BUSY),VoiceMail(${EXTEN}) exten => _1XX,n(NOANSWER),NoOp(Return to RECEPTION ...) exten => _1XX,n,Set(CALLERID(name)=NoAnswer at ${EXTEN}) exten => _1XX,n,Transfer(SIP/100) Put your Reception phone in this context - now when the reception transfers the call to ext 105 for example and does not get answered , the call will transfer back to ext 100 and display "Return from 105" as the Caller ID. In case if you have a proper VoIP carrier, which let you to setup SIP headers, you should add SIP diversion header in order to do call forwarding properly. Some like this (google for more - asterisk sip diversion header): Sending Sip Diversion headers (spawned from dialplan as macro) [macro-diversion-header] exten => s,1,SIPAddHeader(Diversion: <tel:+{ARG1}>\;reason=user=busy\;screen=no\;privacy=off)
