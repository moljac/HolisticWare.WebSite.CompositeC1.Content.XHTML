<h1><a id="">Control Over Gmail IMAP Folders</a></h1>
<p>Default Gmail IMAP folders cannot be removed or set hidden from appearing in IMAP which can be very annoying, especially if u use some kind of search application (Spotlight …) on your computer, which can in turn produce duplicated results, one from your Labels folder and another from All Mail folder.</p>
<p>Well interested thing is that Google is offering us a solution for that problem, in form of <em>Google Labs</em>, specifically <em>Advanced IMAP Control</em>!</p>
<p>First thing, log into your Gmail account, go to Settings (right corner), and choose Labs.</p>
<p>Find <em>Advanced IMAP Controls</em> and set to Enable.</p>
<p>Go to your Inbox, choose Labels, manage Labels and here you go, you now have the option to remove every folder from IMAP!</p>
