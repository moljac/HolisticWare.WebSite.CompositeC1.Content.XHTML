	<p>
		Moljac has held a presentation about cross platform development of mobile applications
		using Xamarin and Microsoft tools.
		<br />
		The main points of the 20-minute presentation were MonoTouch and MonoForAndroid - 
		frameworks for developing applications targeting Apple's iOS and Google's Android. 
		Other interesting notes were about MonoDevelop's recent extensions and working with
		Visual Studio, which tools are necessary and which are nice-to-have.
