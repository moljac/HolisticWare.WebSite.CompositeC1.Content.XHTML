	<!-- ================================================================== -->
	<p>
	On 2011-05-19 HolisticWare team held presentation about current state of the 
	ASP.net on Mono and what can be done for serious/real-life projects.
	<br />
	Due to the events (political and business related) that happened end of April and
	beginning of May 2011 it was questionable whether this presentation has a lot of 
	sense...
	<br />
	Two weeks later team claims: "It has and will have!"
	<br />

	Presentation was intended as teaser presentation to be followed-up with other
	interesting multitargeting, interoperability stuff, but due to minor technical
	problems and lack of time not everything was presented...
