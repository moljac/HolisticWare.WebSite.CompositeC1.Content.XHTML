		In order to deepen my iOS knowledge I have started to read a book by Paul F. Johnson, 
		"Xamarin Mobile Application Development for iOS". 
		<br />
		<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/xamarin-mobile-application-development-for-ios/book">
			http://www.packtpub.com/xamarin-mobile-application-development-for-ios/book
		</a>
		<br />
		The opportunity to read this book was granted by kind team from Packt Publishing in exchange to write
		some thoughts and give some feedback.
		<br />
		So here it is.... First impressions...
	</p>
	<p>
		By just glimpsing table of contents it was something strange - and that is - author explains MonoTouch.Dialog
		almost at the beginning of the book. This could gave user false impression that working with Xamarin.iOS
		is really simple and not too much extra knowledge is required and this is exactly what MonoTouch.Dialog	is
		supposed to simplify development of applications with UITableView and UITableViewCell. MonoTouch.Dialog (MT.D)
		is library written by Miguel de Icaza which abstracts UITableView and UItableViewCell and simplifies 
		sometimes tedious writing of code that utilizes those 2 classes. 
		This abstraction is great for productivity, but hides internals of widely used iOS components/views.
		<br />
		After a brief thinking and with some background in methodology, especially in sports where learning approaches 
		tend to go from easy and simple to more difficult and complex movements and motoric tasks.	
		After first few chapter it was clear that author's approach is very good, giving the reader a possibility to 
		start working on real life applications for iOS using MonoTouch.Dialog without prior in-depth knowledge about 
		platform and tools like XCode which might be quite difficult for .net developers used to Visual Studio.
		<br />
		After brief intro to MonoTouch.Dialog author continues with iOS UI components.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be continued...
