    <h1><a id="">7 Things Highly Productive People Do</a></h1>
    <p class="deck">You have more important things to focus on than, um,
      focusing. Get back on track with these tips.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>You probably don&#8217;t want to admit it</b> but you love
      distractions. In fact, just like monkeys, you get a shot of
      dopamine every time something pulls you in another direction. Why
      do you think you check your email so much?</p>
    <p>Want to be more productive and get your focus back? There are no
      secret tricks here&#8230; do one thing at a time. Stop multitasking&#8212;it&#8217;s
      just another form of distraction.</p>
    <p>Easier said than done, I know.</p>
    <p>Recently I sat down with Tony Wong, a <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=338591&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2"
        rel="nofollow">project management blackbelt</a> whose client
      list includes Toyota, Honda, and Disney, to name a few. He&#8217;s an
      expert in keeping people on task, so I thought he&#8217;d be a good
      person to ask.</p>
    <p>Here are his tips for staying productive:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Work backwards from goals to milestones to tasks.</b>
        Writing &#8220;launch company website&#8221; at the top of your to-do list
        is a sure way to make sure you never get it done. Break down the
        work into smaller and smaller chunks until you have specific
        tasks that can be accomplished in a few hours or less: Sketch a
        wireframe, outline an introduction for the homepage video, etc.
        That&#8217;s how you set goals and actually succeed in crossing them
        off your list.</li>
      <li><b>Stop multi-tasking.</b> No, seriously&#8212;stop. Switching from
        task to task quickly does not work. In fact, changing tasks more
        than 10 times in a day <a
href="http://articles.cnn.com/2005-04-22/world/text.iq_1_mails-iq-messages?_s=PM:WORLD"
          rel="nofollow">makes you dumber than being stoned</a>. When
        you&#8217;re stoned, your IQ drops by five points. When you multitask,
        it drops by an average of 10 points, 15 for men, five for women
        (yes, men are three times as bad at multitasking than women). </li>
      <li><b>Be militant about eliminating distractions.</b> Lock your
        door, put a sign up, turn off your phone, texts, email, and
        instant messaging. In fact, if you know you may sneak a peek at
        your email, set it to offline mode, or even turn off your
        Internet connection. Go to a quiet area and focus on completing
        one task.</li>
      <li><b>Schedule your email. </b>Pick two or three times during
        the day when you&#8217;re going to use your email. Checking your email
        constantly throughout the day creates a ton of noise and kills
        your productivity.</li>
      <li><b>Use the phone.</b> Email isn&#8217;t meant for conversations.
        Don&#8217;t reply more than twice to an email. Pick up the phone
        instead. </li>
      <li><b>Work on your own agenda.</b> Don&#8217;t let something else set
        your day. Most people go right to their emails and start
        freaking out. You will end up at inbox-zero, but accomplish
        nothing. After you wake up, drink water so you rehydrate, eat a
        good breakfast to replenish your glucose, then set prioritized
        goals for the rest of your day. </li>
      <li><b>Work in 60 to 90 minute intervals.</b> Your brain uses up
        more glucose than any other bodily activity. Typically you will
        have spent most of it after 60-90 minutes. (That&#8217;s why you feel
        so burned out after super long meetings.) So take a break: Get
        up, go for a walk, have a snack, do something completely
        different to recharge. And yes, that means you need an extra
        hour for breaks, not including lunch, so if you&#8217;re required to
        get eight hours of work done each day, plan to be there for
        9.5-10 hours.</li>
