		I'm from Croatia (EU candidate) working with .net for 10 years. Right now working
		on mobile platforms targeting iPhone with MonoTouch, Android with MonoForAndroid
		and Windows Phone.&#160;<br />
		In my country devices are fact 2 more expensive than in EU and ore than fact 3 in
		US. Getting into Android Market - no way, Microsoft App Hub - even less way. The
		only marketplace that allows "rest of the world" to join a have equal opportunity
		is Apple's AppStore.&#160;<br />
		Yeah I can push my apps to Android market and AppHub through companies representing
		me, but they charge 30% (yes thirty percent) of what is left after MS and Google
		take their share...&#160;<br />
		It seems that new form of colonialism is raising - giving those US, UK and EU developers
		a jump and head start comparing to rest of us....&#160;<br />
		&#160;<br />
		So Nokians if You want to undeceive us - with wrong color of skin, origins, GSM
		location- help us enter AppHub and borrow us Your device - take our first bucks
		when apps is start paying itself off...&#160;<br />
