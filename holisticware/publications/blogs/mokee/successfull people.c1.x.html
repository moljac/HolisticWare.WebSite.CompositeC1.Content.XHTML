    <p>Why have you been so successful in reaching some of your goals,
      but not others? If you aren't sure, you are far from alone in your
      confusion. It turns out that even brilliant, highly accomplished
      people are pretty lousy when it comes to understanding why they
      succeed or fail. The intuitive answer &#8212; that you are born
      predisposed to certain talents and lacking in others &#8212; is really
      just one small piece of the puzzle. In fact, decades of research
      on achievement suggests that successful people <a

        their goals</a> not simply because of who they are, but more
      often because of <a
href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schwartz/2010/08/six-keys-to-being-excellent-at.html">what
        they do</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>1. <a
          href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/02/get_your_goals_back_on_track.html">Get
          specific</a>. </strong>When you set yourself a goal, try to
      be as specific as possible. "Lose 5 pounds" is a better goal than
      "lose some weight," because it gives you a clear idea of what
      success looks like. Knowing exactly what you want to achieve keeps
      you motivated until you get there. Also, think about the specific
      actions that need to be taken to reach your goal. Just promising
      you'll "eat less" or "sleep more" is too vague &#8212; be clear and
      precise. "I'll be in bed by 10pm on weeknights" leaves no room for
      doubt about what you need to do, and whether or not you've
      actually done it.<br>
      <strong><br>
        2. Seize the moment to act on your goals.</strong> Given how
      busy most of us are, and how many goals we are juggling at once,
      it's not surprising that we routinely miss opportunities to act on
      a goal because we simply fail to notice them. Did you really have
      no time to work out today? No chance at any point to return that
      phone call? Achieving your goal means grabbing hold of these
      opportunities before they slip through your fingers. </p>
    <p>To seize the moment, <a
href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2011/02/a-better-way-to-manage-your-to.html">decide
        when and where you will take each action you want to take</a>,
      in advance. Again, be as specific as possible (e.g., "If it's
      Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, I'll work out for 30 minutes before
      work.") Studies show that this kind of planning will help your
      brain to detect and seize the opportunity when it arises,
      increasing your chances of success by roughly 300%.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Know exactly how far you have left to go.</strong>
      Achieving any goal also requires honest and regular monitoring of
      your progress &#8212; if not by others, then by you yourself. If you
      don't know how well you are doing, you can't adjust your behavior
      or your strategies accordingly. Check your progress frequently &#8212;
      weekly, or even daily, depending on the goal.<br>
      <strong><br>
        4. Be a realistic optimist.</strong> When you are setting a
      goal, by all means engage in lots of positive thinking about how
      likely you are to achieve it. Believing in your ability to succeed
      is enormously helpful for creating and sustaining your motivation.
      But whatever you do, don't underestimate how difficult it will be
      to reach your goal. Most goals worth achieving require time,
      planning, effort, and persistence. Studies show that thinking
      things will come to you easily and effortlessly leaves you
      ill-prepared for the journey ahead, and significantly increases
      the odds of failure. <br>
      <strong><br>
        5. Focus on getting better, rather than being good.</strong>
      Believing you have the ability to reach your goals is important,
      but so is believing you can <em>get </em>the ability. Many of us
      believe that our intelligence, our personality, and our physical
      aptitudes are fixed &#8212; that no matter what we do, we won't improve.
      As a result, we focus on goals that are all about proving
      ourselves, rather than developing and acquiring new skills.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, decades of research suggest that the belief in fixed
      ability is completely wrong &#8212; abilities of all kinds are
      profoundly malleable. Embracing the fact that you can change will
      allow you to make better choices, and reach your fullest
      potential. People whose goals are about getting better, rather
      than being good, take difficulty in stride, and appreciate the
      journey as much as the destination.<br>
      <strong><br>
        6. Have grit.</strong> Grit is a willingness to commit to
      long-term goals, and to persist in the face of difficulty. Studies
      show that gritty people obtain more education in their lifetime,
      and earn higher college GPAs. Grit predicts which cadets will
      stick out their first grueling year at West Point. In fact, grit
      even predicts which round contestants will make it to at the
      Scripps National Spelling Bee.</p>
    <p>The good news is, if you aren't particularly gritty now, there is
      something you can do about it. People who lack grit more often
      than not believe that they just don't have the innate abilities
      successful people have. If that describes your own thinking ....
      well, there's no way to put this nicely: you are wrong. As I
      mentioned earlier, effort, planning, persistence, and good
      strategies are what it really takes to succeed. Embracing this
      knowledge will not only help you see yourself and your goals more
      accurately, but also do wonders for your grit.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Build your willpower muscle.</strong> Your
      self-control "muscle" is just like the other muscles in your body
      &#8212; when it doesn't get much exercise, it becomes weaker over time.
      But when you give it regular workouts by putting it to good use,
      it will grow stronger and stronger, and better able to help you
      successfully reach your goals.</p>
    <p>To build willpower, take on a challenge that requires you to do
      something you'd honestly rather not do. Give up high-fat snacks,
      do 100 sit-ups a day, stand up straight when you catch yourself
      slouching, try to learn a new skill. When you find yourself
      wanting to give in, give up, or just not bother &#8212; don't. Start
      with just one activity, and make a plan for how you will deal with
      troubles when they occur ("If I have a craving for a snack, I will
      eat one piece of fresh or three pieces of dried fruit.") It will
      be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier, and that's the
      whole point. As your strength grows, you can take on more
      challenges and step-up your self-control workout.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Don't tempt fate.</strong> No matter how strong your
      willpower muscle becomes, it's important to always respect the
      fact that it is limited, and if you overtax it you will
      temporarily run out of steam. Don't try to take on two challenging
      tasks at once, if you can help it (like quitting smoking and
      dieting at the same time). And don't put yourself in harm's way &#8212;
      many people are overly-confident in their ability to resist
      temptation, and as a result they put themselves in situations
      where temptations abound. Successful people know not to make
      reaching a goal harder than it already is.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>9. Focus on what you <em>will </em>do, <a
href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/06/how-to-teach-yourself-restrain.html">not
          what you <em>won't</em> do</a>.</strong> Do you want to
      successfully lose weight, quit smoking, or put a lid on your bad
      temper? Then plan how you will replace bad habits with good ones,
      rather than focusing only on the bad habits themselves. Research
      on thought suppression (e.g., "Don't think about white bears!")
      has shown that trying to avoid a thought makes it even more active
      in your mind. The same holds true when it comes to behavior &#8212; by
      trying not to engage in a bad habit, our habits get strengthened
      rather than broken. </p>
    <p>If you want to change your ways, ask yourself, What will I do
      instead? For example, if you are trying to gain control of your
      temper and stop flying off the handle, you might make a plan like
      "If I am starting to feel angry, then I will take three deep
      breaths to calm down." By using deep breathing as a replacement
      for giving in to your anger, your bad habit will get worn away
      over time until it disappears completely.</p>
    <p>It is my hope that, after reading about the nine things
      successful people do differently, you have gained some insight
      into all the things you have been doing right all along. Even more
      important, I hope are able to identify the mistakes that have
      derailed you, and use that knowledge to your advantage from now
      on. Remember, you don't need to become a different person to
      become a more successful one. It's never what you are, but what
      you do.</p>
