    How to Accomplish More by Doing Less<br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Two people of equal skill work in the same office. For the sake
      of comparison, let's say both arrive at work at 9 am each day, and
      leave at 7 pm. </p>
    <p>Bill works essentially without stopping, juggling tasks at his
      desk and running between meetings all day long. He even eats lunch
      at his desk. Sound familiar? </p>
    <p>Nick, by contrast, works intensely for approximately 90 minutes
      at a stretch, and then takes a 15 minute break before resuming
      work. At 12:15, he goes out for lunch for 45 minutes, or works out
      in a nearby gym. At 3 pm, he closes his eyes at his desk and takes
      a rest. Sometimes it turns into a 15 or 20 minute nap. Finally,
      between 4:30 and 5, Nick takes a 15 minute walk outside. </p>
    <p>Bill spends 10 hours on the job. He begins work at about 80
      percent of his capacity, instinctively pacing himself rather than
      pushing all out, because he knows he's got a long day ahead. </p>
    <p>By 1 pm, Bill is feeling some fatigue. He's dropped to 60 percent
      of his capacity and he's inexorably losing steam. Between 4 and 7
      pm, he's averaging about 40 percent of his capacity. </p>
    <p>It's called the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">law of
        diminishing returns</a>. Bill's average over 10 hours is 60
      percent of his capacity, which means he effectively delivers 6
      hours of work. </p>
    <p>Nick puts in the same 10 hours. He feels comfortable working at
      90 percent of his capacity, because he knows he's going to have a
      break before too long. He slows a little as the day wears on, but
      after a midday lunch or workout, and a midafternoon rest, he's
      still at 70 percent during the last three hours of the day.</p>
    <p>Nick takes off a total of two hours during his 10 at work, so he
      only puts in 8 hours. During that time, he's working at an average
      of 80 percent of his capacity, so he's delivering just under 6
      frac12; hours of work #8212; a half hour more than Bill.</p>
    <p>Because Nick is more focused and alert than Bill, he also makes
      fewer mistakes, and when he returns home at night, he has more
      energy left for his family.</p>
    <p>It's not just the number of hours we sit at a desk in that
      determines the value we generate. It's the energy we bring to the
      hours we work. Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically
      between spending and renewing energy. That's how we operate at our
      best. Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy #8212; physically,
      mentally, emotionally and even spiritually #8212; requires refueling it
      intermittently. </p>
    <p>Work the way Nick does, and you'll get more done, in less time,
      at a higher level of quality, more sustainably. </p>
    <p>Create a workplace that truly values a balanced relationship
      between intense work and real renewal, and you'll not only get
      greater productivity from employees, but also higher engagement
      and job satisfaction. </p>
    <p>There's plenty of evidence that increased rest and renewal serve
      performance. </p>
    <p>Consider a <a
        href="http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/zteam/fcp/pubs/jsr.art.html">study
        conducted by NASA, </a>in collaboration with the Federal
      Aviation Administration, of pilots on long haul flights. One group
      of pilots was given an opportunity to take 40 minute naps
      mid-flight, and ended up getting an average of 26 minutes of
      actual sleep. Their median reaction time improved by 16 percent
      following their naps. </p>
    <p>Non-napping pilots, tested at a similar halfway point in the
      flight, experienced a 34 percent deterioration in reaction time.
      They also experienced 22 micro sleeps of 2-10 seconds during the
      last 30 minutes of the flight. The pilots who took naps
      experienced none. </p>
    <p>Or <a
href="http://www.definingsomeday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf">consider
        the study </a>that performance expert Anders Ericcson did of
      violinists at the Berlin Academy of Music. The best of the
      violinists practiced in sessions no longer than 90 minutes, and
      took a break in between each one. They almost never practiced more
      than 4 frac12; hours over a day. What they instinctively
      understood was the law of diminishing returns. </p>
    <p>The top violinists also got an average of more than 8 hours of
      sleep a night, and took a 20-30 minute nap every afternoon. Over a
      week, they slept 16 hours more than the average American does. </p>
    <p>During my 30s and 40s, I wrote three books. I sat at my desk each
      day from 7 am to 7 pm, struggling to stay focused. Each book took
      me at least a year to write. For my most recent books, I wrote in
      a schedule that matched the great violinists #8212; three 90 minute
      sessions with a renewal break in between each one. </p>
    <p>I wrote both those books in six months #8212; investing less than half
      the number of hours I had for each of my first three books. When I
      was working, I was truly working. When I was recharging #8212; whether
      by getting something to eat, or meditating, or taking a run #8212; I
      was truly refueling. </p>
    <p>Stress isn't the enemy in the workplace. Indeed, stress is the
      only means by which we can expand capacity. Just think about
      weightlifting. By stressing your muscles, and then recovering, you
      gradually build strength. Our real enemy is the absence of
      intermittent renewal.<br/>

      The Productivity Paradox: How Sony Pictures Gets More Out of
      People by Demanding Less<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Companies are experiencing a crisis in employee engagement. One
      of the problems is all the pressure companies are putting on
      employees to produce. Workers are trying to get more done in less
      time-and are burning out. But while time is finite, energy is not;
      people can increase their reserves of personal energy. The key is
      to establish rituals-such as shutting down your e-mail for a
      couple of hours a day so you can focus on priorities, or taking a
      daily 3 p.m. walk to get a breather-that renew your physical,
      emotional, mental, and spiritual energy. These behavioral changes
      are sustainable, though, only if leaders at the most senior levels
      of an organization are willing to set a context for them, both by
      creating their own rituals and by setting a tone where people feel
      safe taking time out of the day on a regular basis. This is just
      what the leaders of Sony Pictures Entertainment did. Working with
      Tony Schwartz of the Energy Project, they implemented energy
      management training that has reached nearly half the company so
      far. To date, the reaction to the program has been overwhelmingly
      positive. Eighty-eight percent of participants say it has made
      them more focused and productive. More than 90% say it has helped
      them bring more energy to work every day. Eighty-four percent say
      they feel better able to manage their jobs' demands and are more
      engaged at work. Sony's leaders believe that these changes have
      helped boost the company's performance. Despite the recession,
      Sony Pictures had its most profitable year ever in 2008 and one of
      its highest revenue years in 2009.<br/>
      <br/>
      The new normal means constant change. Companies must reinvent
      themselves if they want to survive. This HBR Spotlight section
      looks at organizational change through two very different
      lenses-the first examining the connection between restructuring
      and improved performance, the second making the case for
      reorganization as a means of keeping a company's structure in tune
      with the human dynamics that drive creativity and innovation. A
      third article suggests new ways to keep overworked employees
      engaged and productive in an economy struggling to recover from
      global recession.<br/>
