    Company to keep the talent<br>
    <br>
    Top Ten Reasons Why Large Companies Fail To Keep Their Best Talent<br>
    <br>
    Whether it&#8217;s a high-profile tech company like <a
      href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/yahoo/">Yahoo</a>!, or a
    more established conglomerate like GE or <a
      href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/home-depot/">Home Depot</a>,
    large companies have a hard time keeping their best and brightest in
    house. Recently, GigaOM discussed the troubles at Yahoo! with a flat
    stock price, vested options for some of their best people, and the
    apparent free flow of VC dollars luring away some of their best
    people to do the start-up thing again.<br>
    <br>
    <p>Yet, Yahoo!, GE, Home Depot, and other large established
      companies have a tremendous advantage in retaining their <a

        target="_blank">top talent</a> and don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve seen the good and
      the bad things that large companies do in relation to talent <a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/12/13/five-new-management-metrics-you-need-to-know/"
        target="_blank">management</a>. Here&#8217;s my <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Top Ten list of what
          large companies do to lose their top talent</strong></span> :</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Big Company
          Bureaucracy.</span></strong> This is probably the #1 reason we
      hear after the fact from <a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2011/12/19/5-signs-that-employees-are-in-survival-mode/"
        target="_blank">disenchanted employees</a>. However, it&#8217;s
      usually a reason that masks the real reason. No one likes rules
      that make no sense. But, when top talent is complaining along
      these lines, it&#8217;s usually a sign that they didn&#8217;t feel as if they
      had a say in these rules. They were simply told to follow along
      and get with the program. No voice in the process and really <a
        href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2011/12/15/leave-your-job/"
        target="_blank">talented people say &#8220;check please.&#8221;</a></p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Failing to
          Find a Project for the Talent that Ignites Their Passion.</span></strong>
      Big companies have many moving parts &#8212; by definition. Therefore,
      they usually don&#8217;t have people going around to their best and
      brightest asking them if they&#8217;re <a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2011/08/29/the-companies-doing-the-most-to-make-their-employees-happier/"
        target="_blank">enjoying their current projects</a> or if they
      want to work on something new that they&#8217;re really interested in
      which would help the company. HR people are usually too busy
      keeping up with other things to get into this. The bosses are also
      usually tapped out on time and this becomes a &#8220;nice to have&#8221;
      rather than &#8220;must have&#8221; conversation. However, unless you see it
      as a &#8220;must have,&#8221; say adios to some of your best people. Top
      talent isn&#8217;t driven by money and power, but by the opportunity to
      be a part of something huge, that will change the world, and for
      which they are <a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemyatt/2011/12/19/this-one-leadership-quality-will-make-or-break-you/"
        target="_blank">really passionate</a>. Big companies usually
      never spend the time to figure this out with those people. <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Poor Annual
          Performance Reviews.</strong></span> You would be amazed at
      how many companies do not do a very effective job at annual
      performance reviews. Or, if they have them, they are rushed
      through, with a form quickly filled out and sent off to HR, and
      back to real work. The impression this leaves with the employee is
      that my boss &#8212; and, therefore, the company &#8212; isn&#8217;t really
      interested in my long-term future here. If you&#8217;re talented enough,
      why stay? This one leads into #4&#8230;. <span style="text-decoration:
        underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. No
          Discussion around Career Development.</strong></span> Here&#8217;s a
      secret for most bosses: most employees don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll be
      doing in 5 years. In our experience, about less than 5% of people
      could tell you if you asked. However, everyone <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">wants</span> to have a
      discussion with you about their future. Most bosses never engage
      with their employees about where they want to go in their careers
      &#8212; even the top talent. This represents a huge opportunity for you
      and your organization if you <span style="text-decoration:
        underline;">do</span> bring it up. Our best clients have
      separate annual discussions with their employees &#8212; apart from
      their annual or bi-annual performance review meetings &#8212; to discuss
      <a
href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2011/12/05/the-path-to-becoming-a-fortune-500-ceo/">succession
        planning or career development</a>. If your best people know
      that you think there&#8217;s a path for them going forward, they&#8217;ll be
      more likely to hang around. <strong><span style="text-decoration:
          underline;"></span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Shifting
          Whims/Strategic Priorities.</span></strong> I applaud
      companies trying to build an incubator or &#8220;brickhouse&#8221; around
      their talent, by giving them new exciting projects to work on. The
      challenge for most organizations is not setting up a strategic
      priority, like establishing an incubator, but sticking with it a
      year or two from now. Top talent hates to be &#8220;jerked around.&#8221; If
      you commit to a project that they will be heading up, you&#8217;ve got
      to give them enough opportunity to deliver what they&#8217;ve promised.<br>
      <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Lack of
          Accountability and/or telling them how to do their Jobs.</span></strong>
      Although you can&#8217;t &#8220;jerk around&#8221; top talent, it&#8217;s a mistake to
      treat top talent leading a project as &#8220;untouchable.&#8221; We&#8217;re not
      saying that you need to get into anyone&#8217;s business or telling them
      what to do. However, top talent demands accountability from others
      and doesn&#8217;t mind being held accountable for their projects.
      Therefore, have regular touch points with your best people as they
      work through their projects. They&#8217;ll appreciate your
      insights/observations/suggestions &#8212; as long as they don&#8217;t
      spillover into preaching. <br>
