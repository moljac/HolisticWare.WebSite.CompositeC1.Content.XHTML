    5 Ways To Spot A Bad Boss In An Interview<br />
    <br />
    <p><em>A boss can literally, make or break your career. Here are
        five ways to spot the bad ones before they become yours.<br />
      </em></p>
    <p>A great boss can make you feel engaged and empowered at work,
      will keep you out of unnecessary office politics, and can identify
      and grow your strengths. But a bad boss can make the most
      impressive job on paper (and salary) quickly unbearable. Not only
      will a bad boss make you dislike at least 80% of your week, your
      relationships might suffer, too. <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.baylor.edu/business/">A recent study conducted
        at Baylor University </a>found that stress and tension caused
      by an abusive boss “affects the marital relationship and
      subsequently, the employee’s entire family.” Supervisor abuse
      isn’t always as blatant as a screaming temper tantrum; it can
      include taking personal anger out on you for no reason, dismissing
      your ideas in a meeting, or simply, being rude and critical of
      your work, while offering no constructive ways to improve it.
      Whatever the exhibition of bad boss behavior, your work and
      personal life will suffer. Merideth Ferguson, PH.D., co-author of
      the study and assistant professor of management and
      entrepreneurship at Baylor explains that “it may be that as
      supervisor abuse heightens tension in the relationship, the
      employee is less motivated or able to engage in positive
      interactions with the partner and other family members.”</p>
    <p>There are many ways to try and combat the effects of a bad boss,
      including confronting him or her directly to work towards a
      productive solution, suggesting that you report to another
      supervisor, or soliciting the help of human resources. But none of
      those tactics gurantee improvement, and quite often, they’ll lead
      to more stress. The best solution is to spot a bad boss—before
      they become yours! Here are five ways to tell whether your
      interviewer is a future bad boss.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. Pronoun usage. </strong><a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.coachbru.com/">Performance consultant John
        Brubaker</a> says that the top verbal tell a boss gives is in
      pronoun choice and the context it is used. If your interviewer
      uses the term “you” in communicating negative information ( such
      as, “you will deal with a lot of ambiguity”), don’t expect the
      boss to be a mentor. If the boss chooses the word “I” to describe
      the department’s success—that’s a red flag. If the interviewer
      says “we” in regards to a particular challenge the team or company
      faced, it may indicate that he or she deflects responsibility and
      places blame.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Concern with your hobbies. </strong>There is a fine
      line between genuine relationship building, and fishing for
      information, so use your discretion on this one. If you have an
      overall good impression of the potential boss it may be that he or
      she is truly interested in the fact that you are heavily involved
      in charity work, and is simply getting to know you. On the other
      hand, the interviewer may be trying to determine whether you have
      too many commitments outside of work. The interviewer can’t
      legally ask if you are married, or have kids, so digging into your
      personal life can be a clever way to understand just how available
      you are.</p>
    <p><strong>3. They’re distracted. </strong>The era of email,
      BlackBerrys and smartphones have made it “okay” for people to
      develop disrespectful communication habits in the name of work.
      Particularly in a frenzied workplace, reading email while a person
      is speaking, multi-tasking on conference calls and checking the
      message behind that blinking BlackBerry mid-conversation has
      become the norm of business communications. But, regardless of his
      or her role in the company, the interviewer should be striving to
      make a good impression—which includes shutting down tech tools to
      give you undivided attention. If your interviewer is glancing at
      emails while you’re speaking, taking phone calls, or late to the
      interview, don’t expect a boss who will make time for you.</p>
    <p><strong>4. They can’t give you a straight answer. </strong>Caren
      Goldberg, Ph.D. is an HR professor at the <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.american.edu/kogod/">Kogod School of Business
        at American University</a>. She says a key “tell” is vague
      answers to your questions. Listen for pauses, awkwardness, or
      overly-generic responses when you inquire what happened to the
      person who held the position you are interviewing for, and/or what
      has created the need to hire. (For example, if you are told the
      person was a “bad fit,” it may indicate that the workplace doesn’t
      spend much time on employee-development, and blames them when
      things don’t work out).</p>
    <p>You should also question turnover rates, how long people stay in
      given roles, and what their career path has been. All of these
      answers can indicate not only if the boss is one people want to
      work for, but whether pay is competitive, and employees are given
      a career growth plan.</p>
    <p><strong>5. They’ve got a record. </strong>Ask the potential boss
      how long he or she has been at the company, in the role, and where
      he or she worked before coming to it to get a feel for his or
      management style, and whether it’s what you respond to. For
      example, bosses making a switch from a large corporation to a
      small company may lead with formality. On the other hand,
      entrepreneurs tend to be passionately involved in business, which
      can be a help or a hindrance, depending on your workstyle.</p>
    <p>Goldberg also recommends searching the site <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.ebosswatch.com/">eBossWatch</a>, where you read
      reviews that former employees have given to a boss. If you’re
      serious about the position, she also suggests reaching to the
      former employee whose spot you are interviewing for, and asking
      for their take on the workplace. (LinkedIn makes this task easy to
      do). The former employee’s recount may not necessarily reflect
      your potential experience, but it can help you to determine
      whether his or her description of the job and company “jibes” with
      what the potential boss said.</p>
