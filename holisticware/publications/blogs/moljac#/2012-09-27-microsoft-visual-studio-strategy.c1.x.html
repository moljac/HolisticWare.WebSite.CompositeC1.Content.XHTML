	It is amazing how Microsoft cuts off its developer community by not supporting some project 
	types for some "older technologies" like Windows Mobile (CF and SmartDevice) in VS2010.

	HolisticWare team is currently porting several Windows Mobile apps to iOS (MonoTouch) and Android
	(Mono for Android) and it is frustrating to be unable to open WinMobile projects in Visual
	Studio 2010.
	</p>
	<p>
	OK -  one could understand that there is no interest for Microsoft in supporting project
	types created by other IDEs like MonoDevelop, but for their own technology? How do they expect
	companies to port their existing "older" projects and codebase to new "promising" technologies
	like Windows Phone (7 and 8) and Windows 8?
	</p>
	<p>
	Yes - solution might be having 2-3 ore even more versions of Visual Studio installed on Your 
	dev box, but what if user needs to have project in the same solution, so the code could be 
	easier ported. And note lack of the discussion regarding VS tools and extensions here.
	</p>
	<p>
	In order to overcome this problem people resort to solutions that lay deep in Visual Studio
	automation model, like Jamie Briant did (and explained in his blog) for MonoTouch projects
	in Visual Studio.

	His code is based on Visual Studio project flavors (Visual Studio Extensibility Platform SDK)
	which enables unknown project types and subtypes to be loaded in VS and worked on it.
