	Got back to mobile development (M4A and MonoTouch) after a while working on Composite C1 stuff, 
	especially on German translation of Composite C1.

	There is still Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian version to finish and some nice features
	that I plan to ease work on Web Sites, but I had to switch just to clear my mind.

	<h3><a id="">Suspicion</a></h3>
	<p>
	Before Christmas holidays there was a lot done with Mono Mobile API. Tests and development.
	In order to extend Mono Mobile API  , 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		reverse-engineered API with ILSpy (just to see source)
		<br />
		ILSpy - new tool to put on the list... This SwissKnife extracts even comments?!?!?!
		</li>
		<li>
		spilt it into projects with help of Project Linker
		</li>
		<li>
		Added Windows Phone rudimentary API for Geolocation.
		<br />
		But the test could not be made without Mango, cos emulator that comes with Mango SDK
		has GeoLocation "mocking"/simulation.
		<br />
		... and (shame) at that point team had no devices to test with... 
		<br />
		Thanks to my Bro
		<a href="http://www.studio-sac.net">
		www.studio-sac.net
		</a>
		the team has right now several iPhones and Samsung Galaxy II S...
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Assumptions are that Mango installation messed something up with VS and M4A.
	</p>

	<h3><a id="">Resolution</a></h3>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Reinstalled latest version of Mono For Android
		</li>
		<li>
			Run CCleaner registry clean
		</li>
		<li>
			rebooted - did not try without it, maybe it could work
		</li>
	</ol>
