How to Write Book Reviews

A book review is both a description and an evaluation of a book. It should focus on the book's purpose, contents, and authority.

Scan the Book's Preliminaries

Before beginning to read, consider the following:

Title - What does it suggest?
Preface - Provides important information on the author's purpose in writing the book and will help you to determine the success of the work.
Table of Contents - Tells you how the book is organized and will aid in determining the author's main ideas and how they are developed - chronologically, topically, etc.
Read the Text

Record impressions as you read and note effective passages for quoting. Keep these questions in mind:

What is the general field or genre, and how does the book fit into it? (Use outside sources to familiarize yourself with the field, if necessary.)
From what point of view is the work written?
What is the author's style? Is it formal or informal? Does it suit the intended audience? If a work of fiction, what literary devices does the author use?
Are concepts clearly defined? How well are the author's ideas developed? What areas are covered/not covered? Why? This helps to establish the book's authority.
If a work of fiction, make notes on such elements as character, plot, and setting, and how they relate to the theme of the book. How does the author delineate his characters? How do they develop? What is the plot structure?
How accurate is the information in the book? Check outside sources if necessary.
If relevant, make note of the book's format - layout, binding, typography, etc. Are there maps, illustrations? Do they aid understanding?
Check the back matter. Is the index accurate? What sources did the author use - primary or secondary? How does he make use of them? Make note of important omissions.
Finally, what has the book accomplished? Is further work needed? Compare the book to others by this author or by others. (Use the listing in the bibliography.)
Consult Additional Sources

Try to find further information about the author - his/her reputation, qualifications, influences, etc. - any information that is relevant to the book being reviewed and that would help to establish the author's authority. Knowledge of the literary period and of critical theories can also be helpful to your review. Your professor and/or reference librarian will be able to suggest sources to use.
Prepare an Outline

Carefully review your notes and attempt to unify your impressions into a statement that will describe the purpose or thesis of your review. Then, outline the arguments that support your thesis. Your arguments should develop the thesis in a logical manner.
Write the Draft

Skim your notes again; then, using the outline as a guide and referring to notes when necessary, begin writing. Your book review should include the following:

Preliminary Information - the complete bibliographic citation for the work ie. title in full, author, place, publisher, date of publication, edition statement, pages, special features (maps, colour plates, etc.), price and ISBN.
Example:
Rory Maclean
Under the Dragon
Travels in a betrayed land
London: Harper Collins, 1998
224pp. $37.50
0 00 257013 0
Introduction - Try to capture the reader's attention with your opening sentence. The introduction should state your central thesis, and set the tone of the review.
Development - Develop your thesis using supporting arguments as set out in your outline. Use description, evaluation, and if possible explanation of why the author wrote as he/she did. Use quotations to illustrate important points or peculiarities.
Conclusion - If your thesis has been well argued, the conclusion should follow naturally. It can include a final assessment or simply restate your thesis. Do not introduce new material at this point.
Revise the Draft

Allow some time to elapse before going over your review, to gain perspective.
Carefully read through the text, looking for clarity and coherence.
Correct grammar and spelling.
Verify quotes for proper foot-noting.

Step 2: Writing Tips	Previous	Next
Here are a few tips that I've found helpful when I sit down to write about a book. Give them a try!

Before you begin writing, make a few notes about the points you want to get across.
While you're writing, try thinking of your reader as a friend to whom you're 
telling a story.

Try to mention the name of the author and the book title in the first paragraph — 
there's nothing more frustrating than reading a review of a great book but not knowing 
who wrote it and what the title is!

If possible, use one paragraph for each point you want to make about the book. It's a 
good way to emphasize the importance of the point. You might want to list the main 
points in your notes before you begin.
Try to get the main theme of the book across in the beginning of your review. Your 
reader should know right away what he or she is getting into should they choose to read the book!

Think about whether the book is part of a genre. Does the book fit into a type like 
mystery, adventure, or romance? What aspects of the genre does it use?

What do you like or dislike about the book's writing style? Is it funny? Does it give 
you a sense of the place it's set? What is the author's/narrator's "voice" like?

Try using a few short quotes from the book to illustrate your points. This is not 
absolutely necessary, but it's a good way to give your reader a sense of the author's writing style.

Make sure your review explains how you feel about the book and why, not just what the 
book is about. A good review should express the reviewer's opinion and persuade the 
reader to share it, to read the book, or to avoid reading it.

Do research about the author and incorporate what you learn into the review. Biographical 
information can help you formulate your opinion about the book, and gives your review a 
"depth." Remember, a book doesn't come directly from a printing press, it's a product 
of an author's mind, and therefore it may be helpful to know something about the author
and how she or he came to write the book. For instance, a little research will reveal 
the following about author Harper Lee:

To Kill a Mockingbird, which won the Pulitzer Prize, is the only book she's ever published.

The town she called Maycomb is really Monroeville, Alabama. Many of the residents thought the
author had betrayed them by writing the book.

Some people think she based the character Dill on Truman Capote, a famous writer who was
 her childhood friend.
