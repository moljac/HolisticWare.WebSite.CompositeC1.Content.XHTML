2 guys bot with MBA
	one - pile of crap - does not hire people with MBA
	other sucked-in the whole meaning of life and destroyed his small business,
	cos he wasn't taught not to involve personal feelings into business, having
	problems with best workers... Selling crap to everyone around until he was
	seen through, by everyone. Only expertize they usually have is lies and more
	lies. I have never met problem solver, but they could talk about problems
	for hours....

Today attended presentation about "cloud opportunities for small ISVs" in
Microsoft Croatia...

Intro
	IaaS
	PaaS
	SaaS

	
Cloud lack of clear definition.
Term comes from telco world denoting telecommunications networks operated by
different providers and no deeper insight was needed or know. So one knows that
call will enter cloud/network and exit on the other side and establish
communication. Later this term spread onto TCP/IP networks to denote some kind
of higher abstraction

What would define cloud service? Or how is cloud service defined? Is it gmail? 
Presonally I have it more than 7 years, so I must be early adopter... Gmail 
enables one to be mobile, to have access to the service "anywhere, anytime"... 
But, does Google read one's mail?

Or is cloud some mail server with imap and public address? With this constellation
user has mobility, but question whether someone reads her/his mail is not present
anymore.

My wife works for telco vendor that sells hosted centrex solutions, meaning
PBX hosted by telco-service provider - telecom. Holisticware (my business) does
integration of on-premise IP-PBXes based on asterisk. So each product sold by
my wife is directly backstabbing for my business. 

But is it so?

True, cloud services are cheaper to start, less infrastructure costs: hardware
and software. This is calculated in price.. Monetization

But I'm more flexible. I have freedom of choice, meaning I can choose route to
redirect my calls, chosing allways cheaper or even free routes I will eventually
reduce costs.
On-premise PBX and mobility? Yes. Wherever I go my office phone rings on 
softphone my laptop or smartphone. With additional hardware like GSM gateways
one can even more reduce costs. 

In croatia iptelephony/voip is rather new and not widely spread, so there is no 
numerical data (or I do not have it) to speak about cost reduction. All I know
from several of our customers is that there is significant amount of savings.
We are trying to get more inforamtion from our customers, to calculate break
even point and ROI.




Cloud service providers for voip - telcos - do not like customers evading their
clouds, because of revenue - theirs. So I was told by my friend, highly ranked
officer in one of Croatian largest then mobile today converged telco operator.
He further stated that my solutions are direct competition and "threat" to them.

Let's do a bit math - proof theory crosses my mind.
So, if on-premise PBX is direct threat to Telcos, because they lose revenue and
I'm supposed to pay to them. This must be meaning that I'm saving money?? Or?


Two oposite/reverse scenarios that give me same result - mobility
	- mail in cloud
	- voip service 


Cons of cloud services?

Configuration? MoH one customer...	

Security?
	Sensitive data?
	Multitenant?
	Security? DDoS? Who's fault?
	
	
Cloud for me

Scalability, 
utilization

Problem

Users are not educated about
Sales and marketing "experts" are pushing hype terms without thinking (OK it is
their job, not to think, just lay and sell, this counts, "yes-to-all")
Nice suits ... 
That's thre reason I'll never have sales or marketing person around, make me
puke...

In early 2000's wh had web-apps as solution to wolrd hunger problem...
